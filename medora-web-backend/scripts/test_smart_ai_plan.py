TEST_TRANSCRIPT = """Hello, how are you? All right, tell me, how's it going since your last visit here? My 1st visit was 2 months ago. I'm 5 days early because I dressed it up. That's okay. I'm not using the sprays right now because the allergy migraines seem to be keeping everything in check. So no Flonase or azelastine now? I take Flonase every day if I need it. And I never used it because this is more for runny nose. So you use that sometimes? Sometimes. That's what stopped it. And then I just use Flonase now. I carry this in case the Flonase doesn't take care of it. Okay. And you take an allergy pill every day? Yeah. Which one is that? Allegra. Okay. And that helps? Yeah. That seems to keep it in check. And you did the dust mite precautions at home? Yes, I did. Okay. And the grass, right? Yeah. And it was worse with eating. So you just use that ipratropium when you're eating? And it helps calm it down. And penicillin allergy, we cleared you and you did it and good, you're off the penicillin chart, huh? My primary care doctor was thrilled. Yeah, that's good. So now he can use it, right? Yeah. So did we talk about allergy shots for you or no? We did, but I can't remember with her and 3 to 5 years getting the shots, you know, I don't think it's worth it if it can be controlled with this. That's fine. If you don't want to. So you just take Allegra every day and it's fine? Yeah. I think Flonase is better if you take it every day. Instead of them? Okay. Because it's more local and it's more steroid. Allegra affects your whole body. You don't want that. Okay. So I'll switch to Flonase every day. Allegra as needed if you need it. And then the Ipratropium for runny nose if you need it. Okay. Maybe the Flonase will just do the trick. Okay. Just do that one spray twice a day or 2 sprays once a day every day. Okay. It'll keep all the inflammation down. You won't need anything else. Okay. Sounds good? Sounds great. So do that and then I'll see you in 4 months, okay? Okay."""

    You are a world-class allergist/immunologist with exceptional clinical intelligence. Analyze this REAL doctor-patient conversation and create a perfect treatment plan.

    CONVERSATION: {transcript}

    INTELLIGENT ANALYSIS REQUIREMENTS:

    üß† SMART CONTEXT UNDERSTANDING:
    - Automatically identify the primary medical condition
    - Understand relationships between symptoms (e.g., "allergy migraines" = allergies causing migraines)
    - Recognize medical achievements (e.g., "cleared", "thrilled", "off the chart")
    - Detect shared decision-making (patient choices about treatments)
    - Identify medication optimization discussions

    üéØ CLINICAL INTELLIGENCE TASKS:
    1. Determine if multiple symptoms belong to ONE condition or are separate
    2. Extract medication changes with reasoning
    3. Identify any medical test results or status updates
    4. Capture treatment discussions and patient decisions
    5. Note follow-up plans and clinical rationale

    üìã SMART OUTPUT FORMAT:

    **CLINICAL ANALYSIS:**
    {{
        "primary_diagnosis": "Intelligent unified diagnosis",
        "key_clinical_insights": ["Most important points from conversation"],
        "medical_achievements": ["Any test clearances, successes, or breakthroughs"],
        "medication_optimization": ["Specific changes with clinical reasoning"],
        "shared_decisions": ["Treatment discussions and patient choices"],
        "follow_up_strategy": "Intelligent follow-up plan"
    }}

    **TREATMENT PLAN:**
    "In regards to [Intelligently identified primary condition]:
    * [Current status with clinical sophistication]
    * [Medical achievements and their significance] 
    * [Medication optimization with advanced reasoning]
    * [Treatment discussions and evidence-based shared decisions]
    * [Specific patient instructions with clinical rationale]
    * [Intelligent follow-up planning]"

    üöÄ ADVANCED INTELLIGENCE FEATURES:
    - Automatically detect condition relationships without templates
    - Understand clinical significance without hardcoded rules  
    - Generate personalized plans without diagnosis-specific patterns
    - Demonstrate medical reasoning like an expert physician
    - Adapt to any medical specialty or condition

    GENERATE: Use your advanced AI capabilities to create a perfect analysis that demonstrates exceptional clinical intelligence and understanding.
