In regards to Urticaria:
Patient is a 4-year-old female with a 2-year history of recurrent urticaria, initially triggered by peanut consumption. The urticaria has persisted despite avoidance of peanuts for the past 2 years, with recent exacerbation following ingestion of ice cream containing nuts 3 weeks ago. Since then, she has experienced daily hives despite treatment with Zyrtec (cetirizine) daily, which was stopped 5 days ago without resolution of symptoms. The hives are itchy and come and go, without associated swelling of the eyes or lips. The patient received a vaccination in April, after which the urticaria has been more frequent.

Plan:
- Perform full environmental allergen testing
- Conduct multi-test for peanut and tree nuts
- Follow-up after testing to review results and finalize management plan

In regards to Food Allergy:
Patient has a history of urticaria following the consumption of peanuts on three separate occasions over the past 2 years. The most recent episode occurred 3 weeks ago after eating ice cream with nuts, leading to daily hives. The patient has not consumed other nuts such as almonds, cashews, pistachios, walnuts, pecans, or hazelnuts, nor has she had reactions to other foods like seafood, milk, eggs, or wheat. She tolerates Nutella without issues.

Plan:
- Continue strict avoidance of peanuts and peanut-containing products
- Comprehensive allergy testing including peanut and tree nut panel
- Follow-up after testing to review results and finalize management plan

In regards to Urticaria:
Patient is a 4-year-old female with a 2-year history of recurrent urticaria, initially triggered by ingestion of peanuts. The urticaria has persisted despite avoidance of peanuts and daily use of Zyrtec (cetirizine). Recently, 3 weeks ago, the patient consumed ice cream containing nuts, leading to a resurgence of daily urticaria. The patient's mother reports that the hives have been present every day since the recent exposure, even after stopping Zyrtec for 5 days. The patient received a vaccination in April, after which the urticaria has been more frequent.

Plan:
- Perform full environmental allergen testing
- Conduct multi-test for peanut and tree nuts
- Follow-up after testing to discuss results and further management

In regards to Food Allergy:
Patient has a history of allergic reactions to peanuts, with three documented episodes over the past two years. The most recent episode occurred 3 weeks ago after consuming ice cream with nuts, leading to persistent urticaria. The patient has not been formally tested for peanut or tree nut allergies previously.

Plan:
- Perform multi-test for peanut and tree nuts
- Follow-up after testing to discuss results and further management

2025-07-02 04:39:21,679 [INFO] Generated enhanced Freed-style plan: Assessment & Plan

In regards to Allergic Contact Dermatitis:
Patient presents with a history of acute allergic reactions, particularly to Quaternium, which was identified through previous patch testing. The patient has been using hair products containing Quaternium, leading to worsening symptoms. Recent treatments included a Kenalog shot and a 30-day course of prednisone, which provided temporary relief. The patient also mentioned using Zyrtec at night as prescribed by Dr. Danziger, which may help with itching.

Plan:
- Schedule patch testing starting next Monday, with patches placed on Monday, removed on Wednesday, and read on Thursday
- Avoid products containing Quaternium and Polyquaternium
- Discontinue use of Aquaphor due to lanolin content
- Use Vanicream HC cream as needed for skin hydration

In regards to Subacute Spongiotic Dermatitis and Eosinophilic Spongiosis:
Patient's skin biopsy indicated subacute spongiotic dermatitis with eosinophilic spongiosis, suggestive of allergic contact dermatitis. The patient's symptoms include an itchy rash on the face and other areas, which have worsened over the last 2-3 months.

Plan:
- Proceed with patch testing as scheduled to identify specific allergens
- Monitor eosinophil levels, noting that previous lab work showed eosinophils at 1.3% (not considered high)

In regards to Eczema:
Patient has a long-standing history of eczema, which has been exacerbated recently. The patient has been using various products, including sunscreens and moisturizers, to manage symptoms.

Plan:
- Continue using Vanicream HC cream for skin hydration
- Avoid Aquaphor due to lanolin content

In regards to Acute Photosensitivity:
Patient reports acute photosensitivity, exacerbated by previous use of hydrochlorothiazide, which was discontinued 30 days ago. The patient takes precautions such as wearing protective clothing while swimming.

Plan:
- Avoid all pain medications, including Celebrex (celecoxib), due to potential worsening of rash
- Continue wearing protective clothing during sun exposure

In regards to Nasal Polyps:
Patient has nasal polyps and is under the care of Dr. John Shelton, who monitors the condition every 6 months without the need for surgery.

Plan:
- Continue follow-up with Dr. John Shelton every 6 months

In regards to Lumbar Spine Fractures, Breast Cancer, Hysterectomy, and Knee Replacement:
Patient has a history of lumbar spine fractures, breast cancer (in remission for 28 years post-lumpectomy), hysterectomy, and a knee replacement in October of the previous year. The patient takes losartan, metoprolol, and rosuvastatin for these conditions.

Plan:
- Continue current medications as prescribed
- Monitor for any changes in symptoms related to these conditions

In regards to Environmental Allergies:
Patient reports being acutely allergic to red tide and possibly to chlorine in pools. The patient has not undergone formal allergy testing for environmental allergens.

Plan:
- Perform environmental allergy testing today to identify specific allergens
- Avoid swimming in pools if chlorine is a potential trigger

Additional Notes:
- Ensure all test results are copied to the patient's husband, Dr. Milton Stratus, as requested
