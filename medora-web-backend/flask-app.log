* Ariana experienced a severe anaphylactic reaction after consuming cashews for the first time, which resulted in swollen eyes, rash, and difficulty breathing, necessitating two doses of epinephrine and treatment at Sarasota Memorial Hospital.
* It is crucial to confirm the allergen responsible for the reaction through skin prick testing for tree nuts, excluding peanuts and hazelnuts, as Ariana has consumed peanuts multiple times without issue and hazelnuts post-reaction without symptoms.
* Treatment plan includes immediate administration of epinephrine via EpiPen in case of future reactions, with Ariana's mother instructed to keep the EpiPen accessible at all times, especially in public settings like restaurants.
* Patient education will focus on recognizing early signs of anaphylaxis, such as swelling, rash, and breathing difficulties, and the importance of avoiding all tree nuts until testing results are available.
* Follow-up appointment scheduled in two weeks to review allergy test results and adjust the management plan accordingly, ensuring Ariana's safety and well-being.

In regards to Nut Allergy:
* Ariana's severe reaction to cashews suggests a possible tree nut allergy, though she has tolerated peanuts and hazelnuts without issue.
* Comprehensive skin prick testing will be conducted to identify specific tree nut allergens, excluding peanuts and hazelnuts, to guide dietary restrictions and emergency preparedness.
* Treatment plan includes strict avoidance of all tree nuts until testing results are available, with Ariana's mother advised to read food labels carefully and inform caregivers and school staff about the potential allergy.
* Patient education will emphasize the importance of avoiding cross-contamination and the need to carry an EpiPen at all times, with instructions on how to use it in case of an emergency.
* Follow-up appointment in two weeks to discuss test results and establish a long-term management plan, including dietary adjustments and emergency protocols.

In regards to Eczema:
* Ariana has a history of eczema, though she has not experienced a flare-up recently, indicating that her condition is currently well-managed.
* Current treatment includes topical emollients and moisturizers as needed, with no recent use of clindamycin or prednisone for eczema management.
* Plan to continue current eczema management with regular use of moisturizers to prevent flare-ups, and to monitor for any changes in skin condition.
* Patient education will focus on maintaining skin hydration, avoiding known irritants, and recognizing early signs of eczema flare-ups to seek timely treatment.
* Follow-up in three months or sooner if symptoms worsen, to reassess eczema management and adjust treatment as necessary.

In regards to Seasonal Allergies:
* Ariana experiences persistent symptoms of seasonal allergies, including nasal congestion, runny nose, and itchy eyes, for which she takes Zyrtec as needed.
* Current treatment includes Zyrtec (cetirizine) as needed, though she has not used it in the past five days in preparation for allergy testing.
* Plan to perform comprehensive environmental allergy testing today to identify specific allergens and develop a targeted treatment approach, potentially including daily antihistamines or nasal corticosteroids.
* Patient education will emphasize the importance of regular use of allergy medications during peak seasons and the potential benefits of allergen avoidance strategies.
* Follow-up appointment in two weeks to review environmental allergy test results and adjust the treatment plan, ensuring optimal management of Ariana's seasonal allergies.

2025-06-14 20:05:24,040 [INFO] Extracted conditions: ['anaphylaxis', 'nut allergy', 'eczema', 'seasonal allergies']
2025-06-14 20:05:32,224 [INFO] Generated Freed-style plan: In regards to Anaphylaxis:
* Ariana experienced a severe anaphylactic reaction after consuming cashews for the first time, which resulted in swollen eyes, rash, and difficulty breathing, necessitating two doses of epinephrine and a visit to the emergency department.
* It is crucial to confirm the allergen responsible for the reaction through skin prick testing for cashews, walnuts, and pecans, while avoiding peanut testing due to her history of frequent peanut consumption without issues.
* Ariana should always carry an EpiPen and her caregivers must be trained in its use; they should administer it immediately upon signs of an allergic reaction and seek emergency medical care.
* Educate Ariana's family on the importance of strict avoidance of all tree nuts, reading food labels carefully, and informing restaurants and schools about her nut allergy to prevent accidental exposure.
* Schedule a follow-up appointment in 4 weeks to review the results of the allergy testing and adjust the management plan accordingly.

In regards to Nut Allergy:
* Ariana has a confirmed allergy to cashews, as evidenced by her severe reaction after first exposure, and potential cross-reactivity with other tree nuts should be investigated.
* Perform skin prick testing for cashews, walnuts, and pecans to identify specific tree nut allergies and guide dietary restrictions.
* Ariana must avoid all tree nuts and products containing tree nuts, and her caregivers should be vigilant about reading labels and preventing cross-contamination.
* Provide Ariana's family with resources on managing food allergies, including emergency action plans and support groups.
* Schedule a follow-up in 6 months or sooner if there are any concerns or accidental exposures to reassess her allergy status and dietary management.

In regards to Eczema:
* Ariana has a history of eczema, though she has not had a recent flare-up, indicating that her skin condition is currently well-managed.
* Continue current management strategies for eczema, including the use of moisturizers and avoiding known triggers such as harsh soaps and detergents.
* If eczema flares occur, consider the use of topical corticosteroids such as hydrocortisone 1% cream applied twice daily for up to 2 weeks, and refer to a dermatologist if needed.
* Educate Ariana's caregivers on the importance of maintaining skin hydration and recognizing early signs of eczema flares to prevent severe outbreaks.
* Follow up in 6 months or sooner if eczema flares occur to reassess her skin condition and adjust treatment as necessary.

In regards to Seasonal Allergies:
* Ariana experiences year-round nasal congestion and other symptoms suggestive of seasonal allergies, for which she takes Zyrtec as needed.
* Perform comprehensive environmental allergy testing to identify specific allergens contributing to her symptoms and guide targeted treatment.
* Consider initiating daily antihistamine therapy with cetirizine (Zyrtec) 10 mg once daily during peak allergy seasons, and discuss the potential addition of a nasal corticosteroid spray such as fluticasone propionate (Flonase) one spray in each nostril daily if symptoms persist.
* Educate Ariana's family on the importance of avoiding known allergens, maintaining indoor air quality, and using air purifiers to reduce exposure to environmental triggers.
* Schedule a follow-up appointment in 3 months to review her response to treatment and adjust the management plan as needed.

* Ariana experienced a severe anaphylactic reaction after consuming cashews for the first time, which resulted in swollen eyes, rash, and difficulty breathing, necessitating two doses of epinephrine and a visit to the emergency department.
* It is crucial to confirm the specific allergen causing the reaction through skin prick testing for all tree nuts except hazelnuts, as she has tolerated hazelnuts without issue.
* Ariana must carry an EpiPen at all times and ensure it is readily accessible, especially in public settings such as restaurants where cross-contamination with nuts could occur.
* Educate Ariana and her caregivers on the signs of anaphylaxis and the immediate use of the EpiPen, followed by calling emergency services.
* Follow-up appointment scheduled in 2 weeks to review allergy test results and adjust the management plan accordingly, including potential referral to an allergist for further evaluation if needed.

In regards to Nut Allergy:
* Ariana has a confirmed allergy to cefprozil and a suspected allergy to cashews, with a history of consuming peanuts without issue until the recent reaction.
* Comprehensive skin prick testing will be conducted to identify specific nut allergies, excluding peanuts and hazelnuts, to guide dietary restrictions and emergency preparedness.
* Ariana should strictly avoid all tree nuts except hazelnuts, and caregivers must be vigilant about reading food labels and inquiring about ingredients when dining out.
* Prescribe Zyrtec 10 mg daily as needed for mild allergic reactions, and ensure Ariana's caregivers understand the importance of consistent use during high-risk periods.
* Schedule a follow-up in 6 months or sooner if new symptoms arise, to reassess dietary restrictions and consider further testing or desensitization if appropriate.

In regards to Eczema:
* Ariana has a history of eczema, though she has not experienced a flare-up recently, indicating good control with current management strategies.
* Continue to monitor for signs of eczema exacerbation, such as dry, itchy, or inflamed skin, and treat promptly with over-the-counter emollients and topical corticosteroids as needed.
* Educate Ariana and her caregivers on skin care routines, including daily moisturizing and avoiding known irritants, to prevent eczema flares.
* If eczema symptoms worsen or do not respond to current treatments, consider a referral to a dermatologist for further evaluation and potential prescription of stronger topical or systemic medications.
* Follow-up in 3 months to review eczema management and adjust the treatment plan if necessary, ensuring Ariana's skin remains well-controlled and comfortable.

2025-06-14 21:07:16,298 [INFO] Generated Freed-style plan: In regards to Allergies:
* Laura has been undergoing allergy immunotherapy, commonly known as allergy shots, since November, aimed at desensitizing her to specific allergens that trigger her symptoms.
* She experienced a setback due to a misunderstanding about the frequency of her shots, resulting in a missed month and a reduction in her dose level from nearly reaching the yellow vial back to the blue vial at a concentration of 0.05.
* Laura should continue her weekly allergy shots to progress through the vials, with the goal of reaching her final dose within the next 6 months; she is encouraged to come three times a week to quickly move past the blue vial and into the yellow vial, after which she can reduce to twice weekly if she is not experiencing reactions.
* In addition to the shots, Laura has been using an oral antihistamine, such as Allegra or Zyrtec, on the day of her shot to manage any immediate symptoms; she should continue this practice and consider adding Flonase or Azelastine nasal sprays if her symptoms worsen or persist.
* It is important for Laura to understand that stopping the shots prematurely could lead to a recurrence of her symptoms, as the full course of immunotherapy typically requires 3 to 5 years to achieve lasting desensitization.
* Follow-up appointments should be scheduled every 6 months to monitor her progress and adjust the treatment plan as necessary; Laura should communicate any difficulties with scheduling to ensure she can maintain the required frequency of her shots.

In regards to Allergic Rhinitis:
* Laura's symptoms of allergic rhinitis are being managed with the allergy shots and the use of an oral antihistamine on the day of her shots, indicating that her nasal symptoms are under control with the current regimen.
* She should continue to monitor her symptoms and report any changes or worsening of her nasal congestion, sneezing, or itchy and watery eyes to her allergist.
* If Laura experiences a flare-up of her allergic rhinitis symptoms, she should consider adding a nasal corticosteroid like Flonase or an antihistamine nasal spray like Azelastine to her daily routine, using one spray in each nostril once or twice daily as needed.
* Education on allergen avoidance strategies, such as keeping windows closed during high pollen seasons and using air purifiers, should be provided to help minimize her exposure to triggers.
* Follow-up visits should include a review of her nasal symptoms and adjustments to her medication regimen if necessary, with the goal of maintaining symptom control while progressing through her immunotherapy.

* Follow-up appointment in 4 weeks to assess response to treatment and review allergy test results, adjusting the management plan as necessary.

In regards to Contact Dermatitis:
* Patient reports eyelid and periorbital swelling and redness, consistent with contact dermatitis, likely triggered by exposure to an allergen in the workplace, given the temporal relationship between work and symptom onset.
* Previous management included oral steroids, with a full course of prednisone one month ago and a few doses two weeks ago, which provided temporary relief but are not suitable for frequent use due to potential side effects.
* Plan to initiate treatment with a topical corticosteroid cream, such as triamcinolone 0.1% applied twice daily to the affected areas, to reduce inflammation and alleviate symptoms.
* Prescribe a barrier cream, such as petrolatum, to be applied before work to create a protective layer and minimize direct contact with potential allergens.
* Schedule comprehensive patch testing to identify specific contact allergens, particularly focusing on substances commonly found in healthcare settings, to guide future avoidance strategies.
* Educate patient on the importance of identifying and avoiding the specific allergen(s) responsible for the contact dermatitis, and discuss the use of hypoallergenic products and protective eyewear at work.
* Follow-up appointment in 4 weeks to evaluate response to treatment, review patch test results, and adjust the management plan accordingly, potentially including referral to an occupational health specialist if workplace modifications are necessary.

2025-06-16 14:41:00,245 [INFO] Generated Freed-style plan: In regards to Seasonal Allergies:
* Patient presents with classic symptoms of seasonal allergies, including runny nose, nasal congestion, sneezing, and itchy, watery eyes, which are exacerbated during spring and fall, particularly when exposed to grass and certain plants.
* He has been using over-the-counter antihistamines such as Claritin (loratadine) and occasionally Flonase (fluticasone propionate nasal spray) when symptoms are severe, but reports that these medications do not always provide adequate relief.
* Plan to conduct comprehensive allergy testing to identify specific allergens triggering his symptoms, which will guide a more targeted treatment approach; this testing was not possible during the initial visit due to insurance constraints but will be scheduled for a follow-up appointment.
* In the interim, recommend continuing with Claritin 10 mg daily during allergy seasons and using Flonase nasal spray, one spray in each nostril daily, to manage symptoms; if symptoms persist despite these measures, consider adding a leukotriene receptor antagonist like montelukast 10 mg daily.
* Educate patient on allergen avoidance strategies, such as wearing a mask during yard work, keeping windows closed during high pollen seasons, and showering after being outdoors to remove pollen from skin and hair.
* Schedule follow-up appointment in 6 weeks to review allergy test results and adjust treatment plan accordingly; emphasize the importance of adhering to the medication regimen and reporting any changes in symptoms.

In regards to Asthma:
* Patient reports two episodes of severe respiratory distress, including difficulty breathing and wheezing, which occurred approximately a year ago and were treated with steroids and a shot, likely an intramuscular corticosteroid.
* These episodes suggest an underlying asthma component, possibly triggered by allergen exposure, necessitating further evaluation to confirm diagnosis and guide management.
* Plan to perform pulmonary function testing (PFT) to assess baseline lung function and determine if asthma is present; this test was ordered during the initial visit and will be conducted before the patient leaves the office.
* If asthma is confirmed, initiate treatment with a short-acting beta-agonist (SABA) such as albuterol, 2 puffs every 4-6 hours as needed for acute symptoms, and consider adding a low-dose inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) like fluticasone propionate 44 mcg, 2 puffs twice daily, as a controller medication.
* Educate patient on proper inhaler technique, the importance of using the controller medication daily even when feeling well, and recognizing signs of asthma exacerbation that require immediate medical attention.
* Schedule follow-up appointment in 4 weeks to review PFT results, assess response to initial asthma treatment, and adjust the management plan as needed; emphasize the importance of adhering to the asthma action plan and avoiding known triggers.

2025-06-16 16:22:18,354 [INFO] Generated Freed-style plan: In regards to Recurrent Pneumonia:
* The patient has experienced recurrent pneumonia, with two episodes in the last year and one in 2008, indicating a significant susceptibility to respiratory infections.
* The patient has received both Pneumovax at age 65 and two doses of Prevnar, yet continues to experience recurrent infections, suggesting underlying immune dysfunction.
* Plan to initiate prophylactic antibiotic therapy with azithromycin 250 mg orally once weekly to reduce the frequency of pneumonia episodes.
* Will monitor the patient's response to this regimen over the next six months and adjust as necessary.
* Educate the patient on the importance of maintaining good respiratory hygiene, including regular hand washing and avoiding close contact with individuals who have respiratory infections.
* Schedule follow-up appointments every three months to assess the effectiveness of the prophylactic treatment and to monitor for any new symptoms or complications.

In regards to COPD:
* The patient has been diagnosed with mild COPD, likely exacerbated by recurrent pneumonias and a family history of smoking, despite the patient not being a smoker themselves.
* The patient has been using albuterol as needed for shortness of breath, which has been helpful since the pneumonias.
* Plan to continue the use of albuterol inhaler as needed, and consider adding a long-acting bronchodilator such as tiotropium 18 mcg once daily to improve lung function and reduce exacerbations.
* Will perform spirometry testing to assess the current severity of COPD and monitor progression.
* Educate the patient on COPD management, including the importance of avoiding respiratory irritants, maintaining a healthy lifestyle, and adhering to medication regimens.
* Schedule follow-up in three months to review spirometry results and adjust treatment plan as needed.

In regards to Low Immunoglobulin Levels:
* The patient's blood work indicates low levels of IgG (485 mg/dL), IgA (31 mg/dL), and IgM (32 mg/dL), with a normal IgE level (6 IU/mL), suggesting a possible immunodeficiency.
* These low immunoglobulin levels may contribute to the patient's recurrent infections and difficulty in clearing them.
* Plan to refer the patient to an immunologist for further evaluation and consideration of intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) therapy, starting with a dose of 400-600 mg/kg every three to four weeks if deemed necessary.
* Will monitor the patient's response to IVIG therapy and adjust the dosage and frequency based on clinical response and immunoglobulin levels.
* Educate the patient on the importance of maintaining a healthy lifestyle to support immune function, including a balanced diet, regular exercise, and adequate sleep.
* Schedule follow-up appointments every three months to monitor immunoglobulin levels and adjust treatment as needed.

In regards to Chronic Hives:
* The patient reports chronic hives that have persisted since a hurricane in September, with symptoms primarily affecting the scalp and occasionally other areas of the skin.
* Previous treatments with prednisone (three different doses), triamcinolone, and fluocinonide have not fully resolved the hives, indicating a need for a more targeted approach.
* Plan to initiate a trial of antihistamines, starting with cetirizine 10 mg daily and adding famotidine 20 mg twice daily if symptoms persist.
* If hives continue despite antihistamine therapy, consider adding omalizumab 300 mg subcutaneously every four weeks to target the underlying immune response.
* Educate the patient on triggers for hives, such as stress, heat, and certain foods, and advise on strategies to avoid these triggers.
* Schedule follow-up appointments every four weeks to assess the effectiveness of the treatment and adjust as necessary.

2025-06-16 19:02:49,183 [INFO] Extracted conditions: ['idiopathic urticaria', 'angioedema', 'allergic rhinitis']
2025-06-16 19:02:58,876 [INFO] Generated Freed-style plan: In regards to Idiopathic Urticaria:
* The patient presents with a history of recurrent hives, described as large, itchy, and resembling a tree's branches, which have been occurring nightly for the past few weeks and intermittently over the last five years.
* These symptoms are consistent with idiopathic urticaria, a condition where the hives arise from within the body without an identifiable external trigger.
* The patient has been self-medicating with generic Benadryl nightly, which provides temporary relief but does not prevent the recurrence of hives.
* Plan to initiate treatment with cetirizine (Zyrtec) 10 mg twice daily, in the morning and at night, for one month to help control the itching and reduce the frequency and severity of hives.
* Educate the patient on the importance of consistent medication use to manage symptoms effectively and the potential side effects of cetirizine, such as drowsiness.
* Advise the patient to avoid non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) like ibuprofen, Aleve, and aspirin, as these can exacerbate urticaria symptoms.
* Schedule a follow-up appointment in one month to assess the response to cetirizine and determine if further interventions, such as allergy testing or other medications, are necessary.
* If symptoms persist despite cetirizine, consider adding a leukotriene receptor antagonist like montelukast or a short course of oral corticosteroids to manage acute flares.

In regards to Angioedema:
* The patient reports episodes of swelling, particularly around the lips and eyes, which can be severe enough to cause a sensation of tightness in the throat.
* These symptoms are indicative of angioedema, which can occur in conjunction with urticaria and is part of the same spectrum of disease.
* The patient has experienced relief from angioedema symptoms following a steroid injection at the hospital, suggesting a response to anti-inflammatory treatment.
* Continue treatment with cetirizine 10 mg twice daily, as this medication can help reduce both urticaria and angioedema symptoms.
* Educate the patient on the signs of severe angioedema, such as difficulty breathing or swallowing, and the need to seek immediate medical attention if these occur.
* If angioedema symptoms persist or worsen, consider adding a short course of oral corticosteroids or referral to a specialist for further evaluation and management.
* Follow up in one month to assess the effectiveness of the current treatment regimen and adjust as necessary.

In regards to Allergic Rhinitis:
* The patient reports year-round symptoms of runny nose, congestion, sneezing, and itchy, watery eyes, which are exacerbated by activities such as yard work, suggesting an allergic trigger.
* These symptoms are consistent with allergic rhinitis, which can be triggered by environmental allergens like pollen, mold, or dust mites.
* The patient has been using generic Benadryl nightly, which provides some relief but does not address the underlying allergic response.
* Plan to initiate treatment with cetirizine (Zyrtec) 10 mg twice daily, which will help manage both the allergic rhinitis and the urticaria symptoms.
* Educate the patient on the importance of avoiding known allergens and using allergen-proof bedding and air purifiers to reduce exposure.
* Schedule a follow-up appointment in one month to assess the response to cetirizine and determine if further interventions, such as allergy testing, are necessary.
* If symptoms persist despite cetirizine, consider adding a nasal corticosteroid spray like fluticasone or a leukotriene receptor antagonist like montelukast to the treatment regimen.
* Plan to perform comprehensive allergy testing in the future to identify specific allergens and develop a targeted treatment approach, once the patient has discontinued cetirizine for five days prior to testing.

2025-06-17 13:28:45,952 [INFO] Generated Freed-style plan: In regards to Chronic Mouth Ulcers:
* The patient has been experiencing chronic mouth ulcers for approximately 10 years, which have been resistant to previous treatments and have not been attributed to stress or other known causes.
* Previous treatments included oral prednisone, which provided some relief, and a prescription mouthwash for dry mouth from the dentist, but these have not resolved the issue.
* Plan to review the patient's recent blood work results from Quest Diagnostics, which include tests for thyroid function, lupus, and other autoimmune markers, to rule out underlying autoimmune conditions.
* If autoimmune conditions are ruled out, consider a trial of topical corticosteroids such as fluocinonide gel 0.05% applied to the ulcers three times daily for two weeks, and advise the patient to avoid spicy or acidic foods that may exacerbate the ulcers.
* Educate the patient on the importance of maintaining good oral hygiene and using a soft toothbrush to minimize irritation.
* Schedule a follow-up appointment in 4 weeks to assess the response to treatment and consider further evaluation by a gastroenterologist if symptoms persist.

In regards to Itchy Wrists and Ankles:
* The patient reports intermittent itchy rashes on the wrists and ankles that have been present for the past two years, lasting approximately one week each episode.
* Previous treatments included over-the-counter itch creams and lotions, which provided temporary relief but did not prevent recurrence.
* Plan to perform a patch test next week to identify potential contact allergens, which will involve applying 479 different allergens on Monday, removing them on Wednesday, and evaluating the results on Thursday.
* In the meantime, recommend the use of a mild, fragrance-free moisturizer such as Cetaphil twice daily to help soothe the skin and reduce itching.
* Educate the patient on avoiding known irritants and potential allergens, such as certain soaps, detergents, and jewelry, until the patch test results are available.

2025-06-17 13:50:36,199 [INFO] Generated Freed-style plan: In regards to Allergic Rhinitis:
* Patient presents with a history of allergic rhinitis, experiencing symptoms such as nasal congestion, runny nose, sneezing, post-nasal drainage, itchy and puffy eyes, and itchy ears, which have been persistent for the last couple of years and are more pronounced inside the home.
* The patient has been using Allegra (fexofenadine) almost daily, which provides some relief, and has tried Flonase (fluticasone propionate nasal spray) intermittently, noting moderate improvement.
* Plan to conduct comprehensive allergy testing to identify specific allergens, including potential indoor triggers such as mold, dust mites, and pet dander, as well as outdoor allergens like tree pollen.
* Based on test results, consider initiating a more structured treatment regimen, including daily use of a non-sedating antihistamine like Allegra 180 mg once daily, and Flonase nasal spray, one spray in each nostril daily.
* If specific allergens are identified, discuss the possibility of allergen immunotherapy (allergy shots) to desensitize the patient to these triggers, with a potential starting dose of 0.1 ml of the allergen extract, increasing weekly as tolerated.
* Educate the patient on environmental control measures, such as using HEPA air filters, regular cleaning to reduce dust, and avoiding the use of fragranced products like laundry softeners in the home.
* Schedule a follow-up appointment in 4-6 weeks to review allergy test results, assess symptom control, and adjust treatment plan as necessary.

In regards to Allergies:
* Patient suspects that indoor allergens, possibly related to the previous flood-damaged home or the new construction, are contributing to the allergic symptoms experienced by the entire family, including the dog.
* The patient has noted some relief when away from the home, suggesting a strong environmental component to the allergies.
* Plan to perform skin prick testing to identify specific allergens, including potential indoor and outdoor triggers, and to assess for any cross-reactivity between allergens.
* Based on test results, recommend specific avoidance measures, such as removing or reducing exposure to identified allergens, and consider the use of allergen-proof bedding covers and regular vacuuming with a HEPA filter to minimize dust mite exposure.
* If pet dander is identified as a significant allergen, discuss strategies for managing the dog's presence in the home, such as keeping the dog out of the bedroom and regular grooming to reduce shedding.
* Consider prescribing a leukotriene receptor antagonist like montelukast 10 mg daily if symptoms persist despite other measures, to help control inflammation and allergic response.
* Educate the patient on the importance of maintaining a clean and allergen-free environment, and provide resources on allergy management and prevention.
* Schedule a follow-up visit in 6-8 weeks to review the effectiveness of the implemented strategies and adjust the treatment plan as needed, potentially including referral to an environmental specialist if mold or other hidden allergens are suspected.

2025-06-17 14:42:34,620 [INFO] Extracted conditions: ['Chronic Urticaria', 'Hormonal Changes']
2025-06-17 14:42:40,728 [INFO] Generated Freed-style plan: In regards to Chronic Urticaria:
* The patient, a young female who recently moved from Cuba, has been experiencing chronic hives for the past year, with episodes occurring frequently and most recently on the past Sunday, indicating a pattern of chronic urticaria that is not associated with food, drug, or environmental allergies.
* The patient has been using cetirizine (Zyrtec) as needed, which provides temporary relief, but the hives recur, suggesting a need for a more structured treatment regimen to manage her symptoms effectively.
* The treatment plan includes prescribing cetirizine 10 mg to be taken every night for the next three months, with the goal of suppressing the hives and allowing the patient's body to reset its histamine response.
* If the hives persist despite nightly dosing, the patient should increase the dosage to 10 mg twice daily, in the morning and at night, to achieve better control.
* Patient education will focus on the importance of consistent medication use, avoiding triggers such as stress, and understanding that chronic urticaria can be influenced by hormonal changes.
* Follow-up is scheduled in one month to assess the effectiveness of the treatment and adjust the plan as necessary. If the hives continue beyond this period, further evaluation, including blood work to rule out underlying causes, will be considered.

In regards to Hormonal Changes:
* The patient's chronic urticaria coincides with the onset of her menstrual cycle, which began approximately a year ago, suggesting that hormonal fluctuations may be contributing to her symptoms.
* The patient's mother reports that the hives started before the first menstrual period, indicating that hormonal changes could be a significant factor in the development and persistence of the hives.
* The treatment plan for managing the hormonal aspect of the patient's condition involves continuing the prescribed cetirizine regimen, as antihistamines can help mitigate the effects of histamine release triggered by hormonal changes.
* Patient education will include discussions about the potential link between hormonal changes and urticaria, emphasizing that this is a common phenomenon during puberty and that symptoms may improve as her body adjusts to these changes.
* The patient and her family should be reassured that while hormonal changes can exacerbate urticaria, the condition is manageable with the current treatment plan, and symptoms are likely to improve over time.
* Follow-up in one month will allow for reassessment of the patient's symptoms in relation to her menstrual cycle, and adjustments to the treatment plan will be made if necessary. If the hives persist, further investigation into hormonal influences, such as thyroid function, may be warranted.

* Educate Mr. Harry on the importance of regular use of his asthma medications and the need to report any changes in his symptoms or breathing to his healthcare provider promptly.

In regards to Neurocardiogenic Syncope:
* Mr. Harry is on a beta-blocker for neurocardiogenic syncope, which was initially prescribed for this condition but also helps manage his blood pressure.
* He has been advised to hold the beta-blocker for 48 hours before receiving allergy shots, a practice he has followed for the past 10 years without issues.
* Since he is currently off allergy shots, there is no immediate need to hold the beta-blocker, but he should continue to follow this protocol if he resumes shots in the future.
* Plan to continue the current beta-blocker regimen as prescribed by his cardiologist, ensuring he communicates any changes in his condition or medication to both his cardiologist and allergist.
* Schedule a follow-up with his cardiologist to review the management of his neurocardiogenic syncope and ensure the beta-blocker remains appropriate for his needs.
* Educate Mr. Harry on the importance of adhering to his cardiologist's recommendations and the need to coordinate care between his allergist and cardiologist, especially if he resumes allergy shots.

2025-06-17 18:37:28,963 [INFO] Generated Freed-style plan: In regards to Allergic Rhinitis:
* The patient presents with a well-documented history of allergic rhinitis, characterized by symptoms such as frequent sneezing, nasal congestion, and itchy, watery eyes that have been persistent and have significantly impacted their quality of life.
* Previous management included the use of over-the-counter antihistamines such as cetirizine 10 mg daily and loratadine 10 mg daily, which provided partial relief but did not fully control symptoms.
* The treatment plan moving forward includes initiating a trial of intranasal corticosteroids, specifically fluticasone propionate nasal spray, one spray in each nostril daily, to be used consistently for the next month to assess efficacy in reducing nasal symptoms.
* Patient education will focus on the importance of regular use of intranasal corticosteroids for optimal control of allergic rhinitis, and the potential need for additional medications such as montelukast 10 mg nightly if symptoms persist.
* A follow-up appointment is scheduled in 4 weeks to review symptom control, adjust medications as needed, and discuss the possibility of allergen immunotherapy if symptoms remain uncontrolled despite optimal medical therapy.

In regards to Medication Management:
* The patient has been managing their allergic rhinitis with over-the-counter medications, but there is a need to optimize their medication regimen to achieve better symptom control.
* A detailed review of the patient's current medications, including any potential side effects or interactions, will be conducted to ensure safe and effective use.
* The treatment plan includes transitioning from oral antihistamines to a combination of intranasal corticosteroids and, if necessary, leukotriene receptor antagonists to provide more comprehensive symptom relief.
* Patient education will emphasize the importance of adhering to the prescribed medication regimen, understanding the role of each medication, and recognizing when to seek medical advice for potential side effects or inadequate symptom control.
* A follow-up visit in 4 weeks will be used to assess the patient's response to the new medication regimen, make any necessary adjustments, and reinforce proper medication use and management.

In regards to Follow-up Care:
* The patient requires ongoing monitoring and adjustment of their treatment plan to ensure optimal management of their allergic rhinitis.
* A follow-up appointment has been scheduled for 4 weeks from today to evaluate the effectiveness of the new treatment regimen, including the use of fluticasone propionate nasal spray and any additional medications prescribed.
* During the follow-up visit, we will assess symptom control, review medication adherence, and discuss any side effects or concerns the patient may have.
* Patient education will include instructions on how to monitor their symptoms at home, when to use rescue medications, and the importance of keeping follow-up appointments to maintain control over their condition.
* If symptoms remain uncontrolled or if new concerns arise, further diagnostic testing or referral to a specialist may be considered to ensure comprehensive care.

2025-06-18 13:08:19,170 [INFO] Generated Freed-style plan: In regards to Shrimp Allergy:
* Patient, Pankaj, reports experiencing multiple episodes of allergic reactions to shrimp over the past few weeks, characterized by the development of hives and shortness of breath, indicating a significant shrimp allergy.
* Immediate action includes strict avoidance of shrimp and all shrimp-containing products to prevent further allergic reactions; patient should read food labels carefully and inquire about ingredients when dining out.
* Plan to conduct comprehensive allergy testing, including skin prick tests and possibly serum-specific IgE testing, to confirm the shrimp allergy and assess the severity of the reaction.
* Patient education will focus on the importance of avoiding cross-contamination and understanding the potential for hidden shrimp in processed foods; provide resources on safe dining practices and allergen-free cooking.
* Follow-up appointment scheduled in 4 weeks to review allergy test results and discuss long-term management strategies, including potential referral to a dietitian for guidance on maintaining a balanced diet without shrimp.

In regards to Anaphylaxis:
* Patient has experienced at least one episode of anaphylaxis following shrimp ingestion, necessitating the use of epinephrine, which successfully resolved the symptoms.
* Immediate prescription of an epinephrine auto-injector (e.g., EpiPen or Auvi-Q) with instructions on how and when to use it; patient should carry two auto-injectors at all times and replace them before their expiration date.
* Education on recognizing early signs of anaphylaxis, such as throat tightness, difficulty breathing, and severe hives, and the importance of immediate epinephrine administration followed by calling emergency services.
* Plan to review and practice the use of the epinephrine auto-injector during the follow-up visit to ensure patient confidence and competence in its use.
* Patient will be provided with an anaphylaxis action plan and a medical alert bracelet to inform others of the shrimp allergy and potential for anaphylaxis; follow-up in 4 weeks to assess adherence to the plan and address any concerns or questions.

2025-06-18 15:17:35,417 [INFO] Extracted conditions: ['possible strawberry allergy', 'eczema', 'seasonal allergies', 'possible environmental allergies']
2025-06-18 15:17:45,981 [INFO] Generated Freed-style plan: In regards to Possible Strawberry Allergy:
* Journey experienced a severe reaction to strawberries at school, characterized by significant lip swelling and a rash around her mouth, which is indicative of a possible IgE-mediated food allergy.
* We will conduct a skin prick test to confirm the strawberry allergy, as well as an oral food challenge under medical supervision to assess the severity of the reaction and determine safe exposure levels.
* Plan to prescribe an epinephrine auto-injector (EpiPen) for Journey to carry at all times, with instructions on its use in case of accidental exposure and anaphylaxis.
* Educate Journey and her mother on strict avoidance of strawberries and products containing strawberries, including reading food labels carefully and informing school staff and caregivers about the allergy.
* Schedule a follow-up appointment in 4 weeks to review test results and discuss long-term management strategies, including potential referral to a dietitian for guidance on maintaining a balanced diet without strawberries.

In regards to Eczema:
* Journey has had eczema since birth, with exacerbations during seasonal changes, which suggests a possible link to environmental allergens.
* Continue current management with daily use of fragrance-free, hypoallergenic moisturizers (e.g., Cetaphil, CeraVe) and gentle, fragrance-free cleansers (e.g., Free & Clear).
* Use over-the-counter 1% hydrocortisone cream for mild flares, applying a thin layer to affected areas twice daily for up to 7 days, and consider prescription-strength topical corticosteroids (e.g., triamcinolone 0.1% ointment) for more severe flares.
* We will perform patch testing to identify any specific environmental allergens that may be triggering or worsening Journey's eczema.
* Educate Journey and her mother on the importance of maintaining skin hydration, avoiding irritants, and recognizing signs of infection, which may require antibiotic treatment.
* Schedule a follow-up in 6 weeks to assess eczema control and adjust treatment as needed, potentially including the introduction of non-steroidal topical agents (e.g., tacrolimus) if frequent steroid use is required.

In regards to Seasonal Allergies:
* Journey experiences seasonal allergy symptoms, including runny nose, itchy eyes, and nasal congestion, which are consistent with allergic rhinitis.
* Initiate treatment with a daily non-sedating antihistamine (e.g., cetirizine 5 mg or loratadine 10 mg) to alleviate symptoms, with instructions to take consistently during peak allergy seasons.
* Consider adding a nasal corticosteroid spray (e.g., fluticasone propionate 50 mcg per spray, 1-2 sprays in each nostril daily) if symptoms persist despite antihistamine use.
* We will conduct skin prick testing to identify specific seasonal allergens, which will help tailor Journey's treatment and avoidance strategies.
* Educate Journey and her mother on the importance of monitoring pollen counts and minimizing exposure during high pollen days, such as keeping windows closed and using air purifiers.
* Schedule a follow-up appointment in 3 months to assess symptom control and discuss the potential for allergen immunotherapy if symptoms remain poorly controlled despite medications.

In regards to Possible Environmental Allergies:
* Journey's eczema and seasonal allergy symptoms may be exacerbated by environmental allergens, such as cat, dog, dust mites, and mold.
* We will perform skin prick testing to identify specific environmental allergens that may be contributing to Journey's symptoms.
* Based on test results, develop a comprehensive allergen avoidance plan, which may include measures such as using allergen-proof bedding, regular vacuuming with HEPA filters, and controlling indoor humidity levels.
* If environmental allergies are confirmed, consider initiating allergen immunotherapy (allergy shots) to desensitize Journey to these triggers and potentially improve her eczema and seasonal allergy symptoms.
* Educate Journey and her mother on the importance of maintaining a clean, allergen-free home environment and the potential benefits of immunotherapy in reducing long-term symptoms.
* Schedule a follow-up appointment in 6 weeks to review test results, discuss the allergen avoidance plan, and determine if immunotherapy is an appropriate next step.

2025-06-23 13:42:50,507 [INFO] Generated Freed-style plan: In regards to Allergies:
* Lila, a six-year-old patient, presents with a history of allergies, including symptoms of nasal congestion, runny nose, sneezing, and itchy, watery eyes, particularly during the summer months, suggesting seasonal allergic rhinitis.
* She has been using chewable Claritin (loratadine) once daily, which she last took over a week ago, indicating inconsistent use that may contribute to her ongoing symptoms.
* Plan to perform comprehensive environmental allergy testing to identify specific allergens, such as pollen, mold, and dust mites, and develop a targeted treatment approach, which may include allergen avoidance strategies, continued use of loratadine 10mg daily, and consideration of intranasal corticosteroids like fluticasone propionate nasal spray (2 sprays in each nostril daily) if symptoms persist.
* Educate the patient and her mother on the importance of consistent medication use and allergen avoidance, such as keeping windows closed during high pollen seasons and using HEPA filters in the home.
* Schedule a follow-up appointment in 6 weeks to assess symptom control and adjust treatment as necessary.

In regards to Food Allergies:
* Lila has been diagnosed with allergies to peanuts, eggs, and shellfish based on previous blood work and skin prick testing, although she has never experienced a clinical reaction to these foods.
* She has been avoiding these foods and carries an EpiPen (epinephrine auto-injector) for potential anaphylaxis, which she has never used.
* Plan to conduct a supervised oral food challenge to confirm or rule out true food allergies, starting with the least likely to cause a reaction (e.g., baked goods containing eggs) and progressing to peanuts and shellfish if tolerated.
* If the oral food challenge is negative, gradually reintroduce the foods into her diet under close supervision, while continuing to carry the EpiPen as a precaution.
* Educate the patient and her family on the importance of reading food labels, recognizing signs of an allergic reaction, and the proper use of the EpiPen.
* Schedule a follow-up appointment 2 weeks after the oral food challenge to review results and discuss next steps.

In regards to Eczema:
* Lila has a history of eczema, which was more severe in her younger years but now presents as occasional patches.
* She is currently using a free and clear moisturizer twice daily and free and clear detergent and soap, which are appropriate for managing eczema.
* Continue the current skin care regimen, emphasizing the importance of regular moisturization to maintain skin barrier function and prevent flare-ups.
* If eczema worsens or new patches appear, consider adding a low-potency topical corticosteroid like hydrocortisone 1% cream to be applied twice daily for up to 2 weeks, followed by a maintenance regimen of moisturizer alone.
* Educate the patient and her family on eczema triggers, such as irritants and allergens, and the importance of avoiding scratching to prevent worsening of symptoms.
* Schedule a follow-up appointment in 3 months to assess skin condition and adjust treatment as needed.

* Sophia presents with a history of seasonal allergies characterized by symptoms such as runny nose, congestion, sneezing, and itchy and watery eyes, which have been particularly severe during certain seasons.
* She has been using Flonase nasal spray daily, one spray per nostril, and taking Zyrtec (cetirizine) as needed, which was discontinued a week ago in preparation for allergy testing.
* Plan to conduct comprehensive allergy testing today to identify specific allergens triggering her symptoms, which will guide a more targeted treatment approach.
* Following the test results, we will consider initiating or adjusting her current regimen, potentially including daily antihistamines like cetirizine 10mg once daily or loratadine 10mg once daily, and continuing Flonase at the current dosage.
* Patient education will focus on allergen avoidance strategies based on test results, such as using air purifiers, keeping windows closed during high pollen seasons, and regular cleaning to minimize dust mite exposure.
* Follow-up appointment scheduled in 4 weeks to review allergy test results, assess symptom control, and adjust treatment as necessary.

In regards to Sinus Infections:
* Sophia has experienced recurrent sinus infections, which have necessitated multiple courses of antibiotics in the past, indicating a need for more proactive management.
* The recent placement of ear tubes last month may have contributed to some improvement in her overall respiratory health, but continued vigilance is required to manage sinus issues.
* Plan to initiate a daily nasal saline irrigation regimen to help clear mucus and reduce the frequency of sinus infections, using a neti pot or similar device twice daily.
* Consider adding a short course of oral antibiotics if signs of acute sinusitis develop, such as fever, facial pain, or worsening nasal discharge, with a prescription for amoxicillin 500mg twice daily for 10 days as needed.
* Patient education will include instructions on proper nasal irrigation technique and the importance of completing any prescribed antibiotic courses to prevent resistance.
* Follow-up in 3 months to assess the frequency of sinus infections and adjust the management plan accordingly, potentially involving referral to an ENT specialist if issues persist.

In regards to Ear Infections:
* Sophia has a history of recurrent ear infections, which led to the recent placement of ear tubes last month, aimed at reducing the frequency and severity of these infections.
* Post-surgery, she has experienced some improvement, but ongoing monitoring is essential to ensure the ear tubes are functioning effectively and to manage any residual symptoms.
* Plan to continue monitoring her ear health closely, with instructions to the family to watch for signs of ear infection such as ear pain, fever, or drainage, and to seek immediate medical attention if these occur.
* If an ear infection is suspected, a course of amoxicillin 500mg twice daily for 10 days will be prescribed, with a follow-up visit to ensure resolution and assess the ear tubes' status.

2025-06-23 15:59:48,857 [INFO] Generated Freed-style plan: In regards to Diverticulitis:
* The patient has been suffering from diverticulitis for several years, and there is a suspicion that certain food allergies may be exacerbating the condition, particularly nuts and soy.
* It is important for the patient to maintain a detailed food diary to track symptoms and identify potential food triggers, as food intolerances may be contributing to the diverticulitis symptoms rather than true allergies.
* Plan to continue avoiding foods that are known to exacerbate diverticulitis, such as nuts, seeds, and possibly soy, based on the patient's reported symptoms following soy consumption.
* Educate the patient on the difference between food allergies and intolerances, emphasizing the need for a food diary to pinpoint specific triggers.
* Schedule a follow-up appointment in 3 months to review the food diary and adjust dietary recommendations as needed.

In regards to Food Allergies:
* The patient has undergone previous blood testing that indicated high levels of IgE antibodies to nuts, soy, pollen, and grass, suggesting possible food and environmental allergies.
* Today, we will perform skin prick testing for nuts, soy, and dairy products to rule out life-threatening food allergies and provide a clearer picture of the patient's sensitivities.
* If the skin prick tests are positive, we will discuss the use of an epinephrine auto-injector (e.g., EpiPen) for emergency management of severe allergic reactions.
* Educate the patient on reading food labels carefully to avoid allergens and the importance of carrying an epinephrine auto-injector if prescribed.
* Schedule a follow-up appointment in 2 weeks to review the results of the skin prick testing and discuss further management strategies.

In regards to Asthma:
* The patient has a history of asthma, which is well-controlled with daily Montelukast (10 mg orally once daily) and as-needed Albuterol (2 puffs every 4-6 hours as needed for symptoms).
* The patient reports that asthma symptoms worsen with smoking, but have improved since quitting 10 days ago.
* Continue current asthma management plan, including daily Montelukast and as-needed Albuterol, and encourage the patient to remain smoke-free.
* Educate the patient on the importance of adhering to the asthma medication regimen and avoiding triggers, such as smoking and environmental allergens.
* The patient will continue to follow up with their pulmonologist for ongoing asthma management.

In regards to Penicillin Allergy:
* The patient reports a history of a severe allergic reaction to penicillin as an infant, characterized by difficulty breathing.
* We will perform a penicillin skin test followed by an oral challenge with amoxicillin (500 mg orally) on July 3rd at 1:00 PM in the Menatee Ave office to assess for current penicillin allergy.
* If the skin test and challenge are negative, the patient will be cleared of their penicillin allergy, which may be beneficial for future treatment of diverticulitis or other infections.
* Educate the patient on the importance of avoiding penicillin-containing medications until the allergy testing is completed and the results are known.
* No allergy medications should be taken for one week prior to the penicillin allergy testing to ensure accurate results.

In regards to Nicotine Patch Allergy:
* The patient has developed redness and itching at the site of nicotine patch application, suggesting a possible allergic reaction to the patch or its adhesive.
* Recommend switching to a hypoallergenic nicotine patch brand and applying the patch to a different area of the skin each day to minimize irritation.
* Prescribe a topical corticosteroid cream (hydrocortisone 1% cream) to be applied twice daily to the affected area for 7-10 days to reduce inflammation and itching.
* Educate the patient on the signs and symptoms of an allergic reaction to the nicotine patch and the importance of discontinuing use if severe reactions occur.
* Schedule a follow-up appointment in 2 weeks to assess the resolution of the skin reaction and discuss alternative smoking cessation strategies if needed.

* Follow-up plan includes monitoring the effectiveness of the current regimen and adjusting as necessary based on the patient's skin condition.

In regards to Peanut Allergy:
* The patient has a confirmed peanut allergy, with previous reactions including full-body rashes and facial swelling after exposure to peanuts.
* A blood test showed a peanut-specific IgE level of 10.5, indicating a significant allergy.
* Plan to conduct a skin prick test today to assess the current severity of the peanut allergy and determine if the patient is a candidate for oral immunotherapy (OIT) with Palforzia, an FDA-approved peanut OIT.
* Patient education will include instructions on avoiding peanuts and reading food labels carefully, as well as information about the potential benefits and risks of OIT.
* Follow-up plan includes reviewing the skin test results and discussing the next steps, which may include starting Palforzia if the patient remains allergic.

In regards to Egg Allergy:
* The patient has a history of avoiding eggs due to a possible allergy, although she can tolerate baked goods containing eggs without reaction.
* She has not had a reaction to fresh eggs since she was eight months old, but she avoids them due to a preference rather than a confirmed allergy.
* Plan to conduct a skin prick test today to assess the presence of an egg allergy and consider a fresh egg challenge in two weeks if the skin test is negative.
* Patient education will focus on the difference between baked and fresh egg allergies and the importance of the upcoming egg challenge to potentially clear her for egg consumption.
* Follow-up plan includes reviewing the skin test results and scheduling the egg challenge if appropriate.

In regards to Pneumonia:
* The patient has a history of two hospitalizations for pneumonia, indicating a significant risk for recurrent respiratory infections.
* She has not received vaccinations beyond six months of age due to parental preference, which may contribute to her susceptibility to infections.
* Plan to conduct blood work to check her immune system function and pneumonia vaccine titers to assess her protection against pneumonia.
* Patient education will include information on the importance of vaccinations and the potential risks of recurrent infections without adequate immunization.
* Follow-up plan includes reviewing the blood work results and discussing the findings with the patient's parents, potentially recommending vaccinations if indicated.

In regards to Possible Immune Deficiency:
* The patient's history of recurrent infections, including pneumonia and ear infections, raises concerns about a possible immune deficiency.

2025-06-23 16:56:15,392 [INFO] Generated Freed-style plan: In regards to Allergic Rhinitis:
* Patient reports symptoms of allergic rhinitis primarily triggered by their cat, including nasal congestion and difficulty breathing when the cat is in close proximity, suggesting a significant allergen exposure.
* Symptoms have been present for approximately a year since acquiring the cat, and the patient also experiences seasonal allergies with pollen exposure, leading to sneezing, runny nose, and congestion.
* Previous attempt with Zyrtec was ineffective, indicating a need for a more tailored approach to managing symptoms.
* Plan to conduct comprehensive allergy testing on Wednesday, October 25th at 12:45 PM to identify specific allergens, including cat dander and pollen, and develop a targeted treatment plan.
* Following allergy testing, initiate treatment with a second-generation antihistamine such as cetirizine 10 mg daily or fexofenadine 180 mg daily, which may be more effective for the patient's symptoms.
* Consider adding a nasal corticosteroid spray, such as fluticasone propionate 50 mcg per nostril daily, to help manage nasal congestion and improve breathing.
* Educate patient on allergen avoidance strategies, including keeping the cat out of the bedroom and using HEPA air filters to reduce exposure to cat dander and pollen.
* Schedule follow-up appointment in 4-6 weeks to assess response to treatment and adjust as necessary.

In regards to Possible Asthma:
* Patient reports morning cough and family history of asthma, suggesting a possible asthma component to their allergic disease, particularly triggered by cat exposure.
* Plan to conduct pulmonary function testing (PFT) with pre- and post-bronchodilator assessment on Wednesday, October 25th at 12:45 PM to evaluate for asthma and assess lung function.
* If asthma is confirmed, initiate treatment with a short-acting beta-agonist (SABA) such as albuterol 90 mcg per inhalation, 2 puffs as needed for acute symptoms, and consider adding a low-dose inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) such as fluticasone propionate 44 mcg per inhalation, 2 puffs twice daily for long-term control.
* Educate patient on proper inhaler technique and the importance of using controller medication regularly to prevent asthma exacerbations.
* Discuss asthma action plan, including recognition of worsening symptoms and when to seek emergency care.
* Schedule follow-up appointment in 4-6 weeks to review PFT results, assess response to treatment, and adjust asthma management plan as needed.

2025-06-23 19:47:59,808 [INFO] Generated Freed-style plan: In regards to Cat Allergy:
* Patient has a severe cat allergy, confirmed by previous testing, with a history of anaphylactic reactions when exposed to cats, including a recent severe episode in a hotel room where a cat had been present.
* The patient experienced significant symptoms such as tongue swelling, throat closure, and severe respiratory distress, necessitating emergency treatment with epinephrine and multiple doses of prednisone.
* Plan to initiate allergen immunotherapy (allergy shots) to desensitize the patient to cat allergens, as the patient is now permanently residing in an area where exposure is more likely.
* Prescribe an EpiPen for emergency use, with instructions to carry it at all times and use it immediately upon exposure to cats or if symptoms of anaphylaxis begin.
* Educate the patient on strict avoidance of cats and cat-related environments, including thorough cleaning of any space where a cat may have been present.
* Schedule follow-up in 4 weeks to assess response to immunotherapy and review adherence to avoidance measures and EpiPen usage.

In regards to Asthma:
* Patient reports ongoing asthma symptoms including chest tightness, shortness of breath, and nocturnal coughing following the cat allergy episode, suggesting an exacerbation of underlying asthma.
* Current asthma management includes albuterol rescue inhaler and nebulizer treatments, which have provided some relief but not fully resolved symptoms.
* Plan to perform a comprehensive pulmonary function test to assess current asthma control and determine if additional controller medications are needed.
* Prescribe montelukast 10 mg daily to help manage asthma symptoms and reduce inflammation, in addition to continuing albuterol as needed.
* Educate the patient on proper inhaler technique and the importance of monitoring peak flow, especially during times of increased symptoms or potential allergen exposure.
* Schedule a follow-up in 2 weeks to review pulmonary function test results, assess response to montelukast, and adjust asthma management plan as necessary.

2025-06-24 13:56:44,232 [INFO] Generated Freed-style plan: In regards to Allergic Rhinitis:
* Patient reports a 10-year history of seasonal allergic rhinitis, with symptoms beginning in March and lasting for several months, characterized by nasal congestion, runny nose, sneezing, itchy and watery eyes, and postnasal drip leading to a thick cough.
* Previous treatments included over-the-counter antihistamines such as Zyrtec, Claritin, and Allegra, as well as pseudoephedrine-containing medications like Tavist D, which were discontinued; patient also tried a Z-pack and prednisone without relief.
* Plan to perform comprehensive allergy testing today to identify specific allergens, particularly focusing on pollen, as patient suspects this to be the trigger; testing will involve skin prick tests for 47 different pollens using small needles on the arms.
* If pollen allergies are confirmed, patient education will include guidance on managing exposure during high pollen seasons, such as keeping windows closed, using air purifiers, and wearing a mask outdoors.
* Treatment plan will be tailored based on test results, potentially including second-generation antihistamines like cetirizine 10 mg daily or fexofenadine 180 mg daily, and intranasal corticosteroids such as fluticasone propionate nasal spray, one spray in each nostril daily.
* Consideration for allergy immunotherapy (allergy shots) to desensitize patient to identified allergens over time, which can be administered weekly or biweekly depending on the protocol.
* Follow-up appointment scheduled in 4 weeks to review test results, assess symptom control, and adjust treatment plan as necessary.

In regards to Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease (GERD):
* Patient reports symptoms of GERD, including thick mucus in the throat and occasional vomiting, which may be contributing to the thick cough and postnasal drip.
* Current treatment includes pantoprazole 40 mg twice daily, which was recently increased from once daily; patient takes it in the morning but not on an empty stomach as recommended.
* Plan to educate patient on proper administration of pantoprazole, emphasizing the need to take it on an empty stomach 30 minutes before eating or drinking anything, including coffee, to maximize efficacy.
* Encourage lifestyle modifications to manage GERD, including elevating the head of the bed during sleep, avoiding excess coffee, tea, alcohol, spicy foods, fatty foods, tomatoes, and carbonated beverages, and eating meals at least 3 hours before bedtime.
* Monitor response to current pantoprazole regimen over the next 4 weeks; if symptoms persist, consider increasing the dose to 40 mg three times daily or switching to another proton pump inhibitor like esomeprazole 40 mg daily.
* Follow-up appointment scheduled in 4 weeks to assess GERD symptom control and adjust treatment plan as needed, potentially involving referral to a gastroenterologist if symptoms remain uncontrolled.

2025-06-24 14:43:22,688 [INFO] Generated Freed-style plan: In regards to Eczema:
* Patient has a long-standing history of eczema, which was initially managed with topical treatments and later escalated to biologic therapies due to severity and lack of response to conventional treatments.
* Previous treatments included Dupixent, which was ineffective, followed by Rinvoq, which initially provided significant relief but later ceased to be effective, and then Nemolizumab, which coincided with a worsening of symptoms including hair loss and widespread inflammation.
* Plan to reassess the current state of eczema, considering the patient's recent use of Prednisone and antibiotics, which have provided temporary relief but not a long-term solution.
* Will explore alternative systemic treatments such as methotrexate or azathioprine, starting with methotrexate at a dose of 7.5 mg weekly, with close monitoring for side effects and efficacy.
* Patient education will focus on the importance of consistent moisturization with free and clear products, avoiding triggers, and understanding the chronic nature of eczema.
* Follow-up in 4 weeks to evaluate response to methotrexate and adjust treatment as necessary, with potential referral back to dermatology for further management if needed.

In regards to Spongiotic Dermatitis:
* Patient was diagnosed with spongiotic dermatitis via skin biopsy, which indicates a non-specific inflammatory condition of the skin.
* This condition has contributed to the patient's widespread inflammation and fluid retention, leading to discomfort and skin shedding.
* Plan to conduct a patch test to rule out contact dermatitis as a contributing factor, which will be scheduled one month after the patient completes their current course of Prednisone.
* Will also consider a repeat skin biopsy if the rash worsens or changes in character, to ensure no new pathology has developed.
* Patient education will include information on potential triggers of spongiotic dermatitis, such as environmental factors, and the importance of avoiding irritants.
* Follow-up in 6 weeks post-patch test to review results and plan further management based on findings.

In regards to Nut Allergies:
* Patient has a history of nut allergies, specifically to walnuts, pecans, Brazil nuts, and hazelnuts, with a notable reaction to Polish chocolate in childhood.
* The patient does not carry an EpiPen and has been managing the allergy by avoiding certain nuts, though they consume peanuts, cashews, almonds, and pistachios without issue.
* Plan to perform skin prick testing today to confirm and quantify the severity of the nut allergies, focusing on the four nuts the patient avoids.
* Will educate the patient on the importance of carrying an EpiPen, given the potential for severe reactions, and provide a prescription for an EpiPen to be filled immediately.
* Follow-up in 2 weeks to review allergy test results and discuss an action plan for managing nut allergies, including strict avoidance and emergency preparedness.

In regards to Possible Immune System Disorder:
* Patient's recent history of multiple biologic treatments and the subsequent worsening of symptoms suggest a possible underlying immune system disorder or dysregulation.
* The patient's symptoms of widespread inflammation, hair loss, and fluid retention are concerning and may indicate an immune-mediated process.
* Plan to order comprehensive blood work to evaluate immune function, including complete blood count, immunoglobulin levels, and autoimmune markers, to be drawn at Quest Labs.
* Will consider referral to an immunologist if initial testing suggests an immune system disorder, to further evaluate and manage this potential condition.
* Patient education will include the importance of monitoring for signs of immune dysfunction and the potential need for long-term management if an immune disorder is confirmed.
* Follow-up in 3 weeks to review blood work results and discuss next steps, including potential immunologist referral.

2025-06-24 15:44:19,741 [INFO] Generated Freed-style plan: In regards to Shellfish Allergy:
* Patient reports two severe anaphylactic reactions to shellfish, specifically mussels and clams, with symptoms including dizziness, near loss of consciousness, vomiting, and rapid recovery post-vomiting, suggesting a significant IgE-mediated shellfish allergy.
* Immediate skin prick testing for all shellfish (mollusks and crustaceans) will be conducted to confirm the allergy and identify specific triggers, with results expected within 15 minutes.
* Given the severity of the reactions, patient will be prescribed an EpiPen (epinephrine auto-injector) to carry at all times, with instructions on how to use it in case of an accidental exposure and subsequent anaphylaxis.
* Patient education will include strict avoidance of all shellfish, reading food labels carefully, and informing restaurant staff about the allergy when dining out.
* Follow-up appointment scheduled in 4 weeks to review test results, discuss any accidental exposures, and reinforce management strategies.

In regards to Asthma:
* Patient was diagnosed with asthma approximately 3-4 years ago, triggered by bronchitis episodes, and currently uses a rescue inhaler (albuterol) as needed, though reports minimal use.
* No recent pulmonary function tests have been conducted, so a spirometry test will be performed today to assess current lung function and asthma control.
* If asthma is confirmed to be uncontrolled, patient will be started on a daily controller medication such as fluticasone propionate 100 mcg, 2 puffs twice daily, to reduce inflammation and prevent exacerbations.
* Patient education will focus on proper inhaler technique, recognizing early signs of an asthma attack, and the importance of regular use of controller medication if prescribed.
* Follow-up in 3 months to reassess asthma control, review medication adherence, and adjust treatment plan as necessary.

In regards to Psoriasis:
* Patient manages psoriasis with topical treatments including clobetasol cream and over-the-counter MG217 (coal tar) applied overnight under Saran wrap, reporting good control of symptoms.
* Current treatment regimen will be continued as it is effective, with a reminder to monitor for any signs of skin thinning or other side effects from prolonged use of clobetasol.
* Patient education will include the importance of moisturizing regularly, avoiding triggers such as stress and certain medications, and seeking medical attention if psoriasis worsens or becomes unmanageable with current treatments.
* Follow-up in 6 months or sooner if psoriasis flares up, to reassess treatment efficacy and consider alternative therapies if needed.

In regards to Seasonal Allergies:
* Patient experiences mild seasonal allergy symptoms, primarily left-sided nasal congestion during morning walks, suggestive of pollen allergy.
* Comprehensive environmental allergy testing will be conducted today to identify specific allergens, with results expected within 15 minutes.
* Based on test results, patient may be prescribed an antihistamine such as cetirizine 10 mg daily during high pollen seasons to manage symptoms.
* Patient education will include strategies to minimize exposure to allergens, such as wearing a mask during high pollen counts, keeping windows closed, and using air purifiers.
* Follow-up in 3 months to review allergy test results, assess symptom control, and adjust treatment plan as needed.

In regards to High Cholesterol:
* Patient reports a diagnosis of high cholesterol, but no current treatment or recent monitoring was mentioned.
* A referral to a primary care physician or cardiologist will be made for a comprehensive lipid panel and to discuss appropriate management strategies.
* Patient education will emphasize the importance of a heart-healthy diet, regular exercise, and potential need for cholesterol-lowering medications such as statins if lifestyle modifications are insufficient.
* Follow-up in 6 months to ensure patient has followed up with a specialist and to review any changes in cholesterol management plan.

2025-06-24 16:44:29,356 [INFO] Extracted conditions: ['pneumonia', 'wheezing', 'possible allergies', 'potential immune system issue']
2025-06-24 16:44:38,492 [INFO] Generated Freed-style plan: In regards to Pneumonia:
* Anna, a four-year-old patient, has experienced two episodes of pneumonia within the past year, the most recent being a case of walking pneumonia treated initially with amoxicillin for three days without improvement, followed by acetaminophen which led to some improvement.
* Given the recurrence of pneumonia, it is crucial to assess her immune system function to rule out any underlying immunodeficiency that might be contributing to her susceptibility to infections; blood work will be ordered and conducted at Quest Diagnostics.
* The treatment plan for the recent pneumonia included albuterol every four to six hours as needed and budesonide via a nebulizer, which helped manage her respiratory symptoms; she has since transitioned to using a fluticasone inhaler, 2 puffs twice daily, which has led to further improvement.
* Patient education will focus on the importance of completing the full course of antibiotics when prescribed, the role of vaccinations in preventing infections, and the need for prompt medical attention if symptoms of pneumonia reoccur.
* Follow-up will include a review of her immune system test results and a reassessment of her respiratory status in one month or sooner if symptoms return.

In regards to Wheezing:
* Anna has experienced wheezing on two separate occasions, the first at seven months of age and the most recent associated with her recent pneumonia; both episodes required the use of steroids for management.
* The current treatment regimen includes albuterol as needed and a fluticasone inhaler, 2 puffs twice daily, which has been effective in controlling her wheezing and improving her respiratory function.
* The plan is to continue the current regimen of fluticasone and albuterol, with close monitoring for any signs of increased wheezing or respiratory distress; if symptoms worsen, a short course of oral prednisone may be considered.
* Patient education will emphasize the correct use of inhalers, the importance of adhering to the prescribed regimen, and recognizing signs of worsening symptoms that require immediate medical attention.
* Follow-up will be scheduled in one month to assess her respiratory status and adjust treatment as necessary.

In regards to Possible Allergies:
* Anna's family history of allergies, including her mother's celiac disease and other allergies, suggests a possible atopic predisposition; she has also experienced some seasonal allergy symptoms such as nasal congestion.
* Comprehensive allergy testing, including prick testing, is planned for July 1st at 8:45 AM to identify specific allergens that may be contributing to her symptoms.
* Current treatment does not include any allergy medications such as Zyrtec or Allegra, but these may be considered based on the results of her allergy testing.
* Patient education will cover the nature of allergies, the importance of avoiding known allergens, and the potential benefits of allergy medications and immunotherapy if indicated.
* Follow-up after allergy testing will involve discussing the results, initiating appropriate allergy management strategies, and scheduling further appointments as needed.

In regards to Potential Immune System Issue:
* Given Anna's two episodes of pneumonia within a year, there is concern for a possible underlying immune system issue that may be contributing to her increased susceptibility to infections.
* Blood work to assess her immune system function has been ordered and will be conducted at Quest Diagnostics; this will help determine if there is an immunodeficiency that needs to be addressed.
* No specific treatment for an immune system issue is currently prescribed, but this will be determined based on the results of her blood work.
* Patient education will focus on the importance of the immune system in fighting infections, the potential implications of an immunodeficiency, and the need for regular follow-up to monitor her health.
* Follow-up will include a review of her immune system test results and a discussion of any necessary interventions or further testing based on those results.

2025-06-25 13:13:59,973 [INFO] Generated Freed-style plan: In regards to Eczema:
* The infant has been diagnosed with eczema since birth, presenting with dry skin and itching, which has been a persistent issue affecting the quality of life for both the baby and the parents.
* The parents have been using a combination of treatments, including an antiviral medication due to a recent infection, and occasionally applying cortisone cream, which has provided some relief but not consistently.
* The current treatment plan includes the use of Vanicream, a fragrance-free, hypoallergenic moisturizer, to be applied twice daily to the entire body to help manage the dryness and itching associated with eczema.
* Additionally, the parents are advised to use Free and Clear detergent and conditioner to minimize potential irritants that could exacerbate the eczema.
* Patient education will focus on the importance of regular and thorough moisturization, as well as avoiding known irritants and allergens, to manage and potentially improve the eczema symptoms.
* A follow-up appointment is scheduled in four weeks to assess the effectiveness of the current regimen and make any necessary adjustments. At this visit, we will also discuss any new symptoms or changes in the baby's condition and consider further interventions if needed, such as prescription topical steroids or referral to a dermatologist for more specialized care.

2025-06-25 13:47:28,144 [INFO] Generated Freed-style plan: In regards to Allergies:
* The patient has been receiving allergy immunotherapy, specifically on the red wire .3 protocol, which they started in March 2024 and reached maintenance dosage in April of this year, indicating a successful progression in managing their allergies.
* They have been maintaining a schedule of receiving shots every two weeks, which has been effective in reducing their allergic symptoms, as they report their allergies are better and they have not experienced any local or systemic reactions to the shots.
* The patient uses Flonase and Azelastine nasal sprays as needed, and Allegra and ketotifen eye drops on an as-needed basis, which has been sufficient for managing symptoms, particularly noting increased need for these medications in the past couple of weeks due to itchy eyes.
* Plan to continue the current immunotherapy schedule of every two weeks for the next six months, after which we will consider spacing out the shots further if the patient's condition continues to improve.
* Will refill prescriptions for Flonase and Azelastine nasal sprays and send them to CVS, as the patient has limited refills remaining.
* Educate the patient on the importance of continuing their current regimen and monitoring for any changes in symptoms, and to contact the office if they experience any adverse reactions or if their symptoms worsen.
* Schedule a follow-up appointment in six months to reassess the patient's response to immunotherapy and adjust the treatment plan as necessary.

In regards to Asthma:
* The patient reports improved asthma control, with symptoms primarily triggered by exercise and managed effectively with albuterol as needed, indicating good control of their asthma.
* They have been avoiding raw fruits and vegetables, which previously caused issues, suggesting a possible oral allergy syndrome component to their asthma.
* Plan to continue the current regimen of using albuterol as needed for exercise-induced asthma symptoms, and to monitor for any changes in asthma control.
* Educate the patient on the importance of continuing to avoid known food triggers and to use albuterol appropriately to manage exercise-induced symptoms.
* Discuss the potential for reintroducing raw fruits and vegetables after another year of immunotherapy, as their tolerance may improve with continued treatment.
* Schedule a follow-up appointment in six months to reassess asthma control and adjust the treatment plan as necessary, including considering the reintroduction of previously avoided foods if the patient's condition allows.

* The patient has been diagnosed with allergic rhinitis, primarily triggered by grass and two types of mold, Cladosporium and Penicillium, as confirmed by skin testing.
* Symptoms include nasal congestion, which worsens during high pollen seasons and when in close proximity to cats, although the cat allergy was not confirmed by the skin test.
* The treatment plan includes the use of fluticasone nasal spray, one spray in each nostril in the morning, and another nasal spray at night, with instructions to stand up, look down, and aim the spray outward to allow it to drip down the nasal passage without tilting the head back.
* Additionally, the patient will use levocetirizine as an oral antihistamine on an as-needed basis, not daily, to manage symptoms.
* Patient education includes understanding that these medications will help control symptoms, and they should be used consistently as prescribed.
* Follow-up is scheduled in two months to assess the effectiveness of the nasal sprays and antihistamine, and to discuss the possibility of allergy shots for long-term management of grass and mold allergies.
* The patient is informed about the potential benefits of allergy immunotherapy, which involves a commitment of three to five years with weekly, then biweekly, and eventually monthly injections to reduce sensitivity to allergens over time.

In regards to Asthma:
* The patient exhibits mild asthma, evidenced by mild obstruction on the breathing test and reports of feeling short of breath, particularly around cats.
* An inhaler has been prescribed for use as needed to manage asthma symptoms, although the patient did not feel significantly better after the breathing treatment during the visit.
* The treatment plan emphasizes the importance of using the inhaler at the onset of symptoms to prevent exacerbations.
* Patient education includes instructions on proper inhaler technique and the importance of monitoring symptoms and using the inhaler proactively.
* Follow-up will be part of the two-month visit to evaluate asthma control and adjust the treatment plan if necessary, including the potential addition of a controller medication if symptoms persist.

In regards to Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease (GERD):
* The patient reports symptoms of acid reflux, which can contribute to cough and nasal congestion.
* A trial of Pepcid (famotidine) is prescribed, to be taken twice daily for one month, to manage acid reflux symptoms.
* Lifestyle modifications are recommended, including reducing intake of coffee, tea, alcohol, spicy foods, and fatty foods, eating meals at least three hours before bedtime, and sleeping with the head of the bed elevated.
* Patient education focuses on the connection between GERD and respiratory symptoms, and the importance of adhering to the medication and lifestyle changes.
* Follow-up is scheduled in two months to assess the effectiveness of Pepcid and lifestyle modifications, with the understanding that the medication will be discontinued after one month unless symptoms persist.

2025-06-25 18:26:01,643 [INFO] Generated Freed-style plan: In regards to Asthma:
* Megan's asthma appears to be well-controlled based on her recent breathing test results, with a 100% score today and 103% in October, indicating stable lung function and no current symptoms.
* She has successfully discontinued her asthma medications, including Singulair and albuterol, since February without experiencing any exacerbations or need for rescue inhaler use, suggesting her asthma may be in remission or very mild.
* Given her current status, the plan is to continue monitoring her asthma without restarting controller medications at this time, but to have her keep a peak flow meter at home and use it daily to track her lung function.
* Megan should be educated on the signs and symptoms of asthma exacerbation, such as increased shortness of breath, wheezing, or chest tightness, and instructed to resume albuterol as needed and contact the office if these occur.
* Follow-up appointment scheduled in 6 months to reassess her asthma control and breathing test results, with instructions to call sooner if any symptoms re-emerge.

In regards to Allergic Rhinitis:
* Megan reports no current symptoms of allergic rhinitis, having successfully managed her condition with as-needed Zyrtec and nasal sprays (Nasacort and NasalCrom) since her last visit in February.
* She works with dogs and has not experienced any allergic reactions or worsening of symptoms in this environment, indicating good control of her allergic triggers.
* The plan is to continue her current regimen of Zyrtec as needed for any breakthrough symptoms and to use Nasacort and NasalCrom daily during high pollen seasons or if symptoms worsen.
* Megan should be educated on the importance of consistent use of nasal sprays during allergy season to maintain symptom control and prevent exacerbations.
* She will keep a symptom diary to track any nasal congestion, sneezing, or eye symptoms, particularly in relation to her work with dogs or after eating, as she previously noted some correlation.
* Follow-up appointment scheduled in 6 months to review her symptom diary and adjust her treatment plan as needed, with instructions to call sooner if symptoms significantly worsen or if new triggers are identified.

2025-06-25 18:53:41,841 [INFO] Generated Freed-style plan: In regards to Allergies:
* Patient is currently undergoing allergy immunotherapy with shots administered every four weeks, with the last shot received on June 6th, and the next shot due around July 4th, though patient may need to adjust timing due to impending childbirth.
* Patient is taking Flonase daily, Zyrtec every night, Montelukast the night before, the night of, and the night after the shot, and Allegra on the day of the shot to manage symptoms and prevent local reactions from the shots; patient has not tried to stop Flonase to assess its necessity.
* Plan to continue allergy shots for at least one more year, aiming for a total of five years of treatment, and reassess the need for medications post-childbirth; patient should attempt to reduce Flonase use gradually to determine if it is still necessary given the ongoing immunotherapy.
* Patient education includes understanding that allergy shots may be reducing the need for daily medications, and to monitor symptoms closely after attempting to reduce Flonase; follow-up will be scheduled in four months to review progress and adjust treatment as needed, including a breathing test to assess any respiratory changes.

In regards to Hypertension:
* Patient has a history of hypertension and is currently managed with nifedipine, which was chosen over labetalol by the high-risk maternal-fetal medicine team to control blood pressure during pregnancy.
* Patient's blood pressure is being closely monitored due to the high-risk nature of the pregnancy, with weekly doctor's appointments to assess any changes and adjust treatment as necessary.
* Plan to continue current antihypertensive regimen with nifedipine and coordinate with the patient's obstetric and primary care teams to ensure blood pressure remains stable; any changes in medication or dosage will be communicated to all relevant healthcare providers.
* Patient education includes the importance of adhering to the prescribed medication regimen and attending all scheduled appointments; follow-up will be coordinated with the obstetric team post-delivery to reassess blood pressure management and adjust medications as needed.

In regards to High-Risk Pregnancy:
* Patient is at 36 weeks gestation and considered high-risk due to pre-existing hypertension, current use of blood thinners, and fluctuating creatinine levels, with a planned delivery at 37 weeks or earlier if necessary.
* Patient is on nifedipine for blood pressure control and is being monitored closely with weekly appointments to assess the need for earlier delivery and to manage any complications that may arise.
* Plan to coordinate closely with the patient's obstetric team to ensure a safe delivery and monitor for any complications related to the patient's medical conditions; any changes in the patient's condition or delivery plan will be communicated promptly.
* Patient education includes understanding the reasons for the high-risk classification and the importance of following the obstetric team's recommendations; follow-up will be scheduled post-delivery to assess the patient's overall health and adjust any ongoing treatments as needed.

2025-06-26 12:27:19,094 [INFO] Generated Freed-style plan: In regards to Hives:
* The patient has been experiencing hives, which have been successfully managed with Xolair injections since September, indicating a chronic urticaria condition that has responded well to this biologic therapy.
* The patient was previously on a regimen that included Allegra, Pepcid, Ciproheptadine, hydroxyzine, and Montelukast, but these medications were gradually discontinued over the past few months without recurrence of hives, suggesting that Xolair alone is currently sufficient for control.
* The treatment plan is to continue Xolair injections at the current dosage and schedule, as the patient has achieved remission and should remain on this therapy for at least one year post-remission to prevent relapse.
* Patient education includes understanding the importance of continuing Xolair to maintain remission and the potential risks of discontinuing too early, which could lead to a return of symptoms.
* Follow-up is scheduled in four months to monitor the patient's condition and discuss potential tapering of Xolair after the recommended one-year period post-remission.

In regards to Swelling:
* The patient experienced swelling, particularly noted during a stressful event around the time of Hurricane Milton, which required the use of Prednisone and an adjustment of antihistamines to manage the symptoms effectively.
* The patient's current medication regimen does not include any medications specifically for swelling, as it has been controlled with the Xolair used for hives.
* The treatment plan is to continue monitoring for any signs of swelling and to use Xolair as the primary therapy, with the understanding that additional medications like Prednisone may be necessary if swelling recurs.
* Patient education includes recognizing early signs of swelling and understanding the potential need for additional medications like Prednisone in acute situations, as well as the importance of stress management to prevent exacerbations.
* Follow-up in four months will include a review of any swelling episodes and adjustment of the treatment plan as necessary, ensuring the patient remains well-informed about their condition and management strategies.

2025-06-26 12:33:02,521 [INFO] Generated Freed-style plan: In regards to Asthma:
* The patient has a history of asthma that was exacerbated during a stressful period in May when they were cleaning out their deceased daughter's belongings, which likely increased exposure to dust and other triggers.
* The patient has been using AsthNex, a long-acting beta-agonist inhaler, inconsistently, with usage varying from one to two puffs in the morning and occasionally in the evening, depending on symptom severity.
* The patient also used albuterol, a short-acting beta-agonist, more frequently during the stressful period but has not needed it recently.
* Plan to increase the AsthNex dosage to two puffs twice daily to better control asthma symptoms and prevent exacerbations, as the patient's current regimen is not sufficient.
* Educate the patient on the importance of consistent use of controller medications like AsthNex to maintain asthma control and prevent symptoms, especially during times of increased stress or allergen exposure.
* Schedule a follow-up appointment in 4-6 weeks to assess asthma control and adjust the treatment plan as needed, including potential addition of other controller medications if symptoms persist.

In regards to Allergies:
* The patient has a history of allergies to weeds and dogs, confirmed by previous allergy testing, but not to dust, despite recent exposure during cleaning activities.
* The patient has not been using prescribed nasal spray or antihistamines regularly, only taking antihistamines seasonally when symptoms are present.
* The patient declined allergy shots in the past due to the complexity of their allergies, including sensitivities to preservatives, and the presence of a dog at home.
* Plan to reinforce the importance of using antihistamines like levocetirizine during allergy seasons to manage symptoms effectively, and consider prescribing a nasal spray like fluticasone for additional control if needed.
* Educate the patient on allergen avoidance strategies, such as minimizing exposure to weeds and dogs when possible, and using HEPA filters at home to reduce indoor allergens.
* Discuss the potential benefits of allergy shots again, emphasizing that they could help desensitize the patient to specific allergens and improve overall quality of life, while addressing concerns about preservatives and the presence of a dog.
* Schedule a follow-up appointment in 3 months to reassess allergy symptoms and treatment efficacy, and consider referral to an allergist for further evaluation and management if symptoms persist or worsen.

2025-06-26 13:06:08,125 [INFO] Generated Freed-style plan: In regards to Allergic Rhinitis:
* Patient presents with a one-year history of persistent nasal congestion and sniffling, which began while working in an environment with industrial fans, suggesting a possible occupational exposure trigger; however, symptoms persist despite removal from that environment.
* The patient has tried over-the-counter medications such as Claritin (loratadine) and prescription medications including Zyrtec (cetirizine) and Montelukast, as well as a nasal spray provided at the work camp, all without significant relief.
* Plan to conduct comprehensive allergy testing to identify specific allergens contributing to the patient's symptoms, as the current medications have been ineffective; testing will help tailor a more effective treatment regimen.
* Educate the patient on the importance of adhering to the new treatment plan once allergens are identified, and discuss potential environmental control measures to minimize exposure to identified allergens.
* Schedule follow-up appointment two weeks after initiating new treatment to assess symptom control and adjust therapy as needed.

In regards to Chronic Rhinitis:
* Patient reports constant nasal congestion and a slight postnasal drip, which may indicate chronic rhinitis, possibly exacerbated by the initial occupational exposure to industrial fans.
* Previous treatments with antihistamines and Montelukast have not alleviated symptoms, suggesting a need for a different approach to manage chronic inflammation.
* Plan to initiate a trial of intranasal corticosteroids, such as Fluticasone propionate (Flonase) 50 mcg per spray, two sprays in each nostril once daily for two weeks, to target the underlying inflammation causing the chronic symptoms.
* Educate the patient on proper administration technique for intranasal corticosteroids and the importance of consistent use to achieve maximum benefit.
* Schedule follow-up in two weeks to evaluate the effectiveness of the intranasal corticosteroid and consider additional therapies, such as saline nasal irrigation, if symptoms persist.

In regards to Possible Sinusitis:
* Patient mentions a slight postnasal drip and pressure in the nasal area, particularly when pressing on a healed tooth extraction site, which could suggest a component of sinusitis contributing to the overall symptom complex.
* No history of recurrent sinus infections or other respiratory infections reported, but the presence of pressure and postnasal drip warrants further investigation.
* Plan to refer the patient for a sinus CT scan to rule out chronic sinusitis or any anatomical abnormalities that may be contributing to the symptoms.
* Educate the patient on the signs and symptoms of sinusitis and the importance of completing the full course of any prescribed antibiotics if sinusitis is confirmed.
* Schedule follow-up appointment one week after the CT scan to review results and discuss further management, which may include a course of antibiotics or referral to an ENT specialist if necessary.

2025-06-26 15:12:17,728 [INFO] Generated Freed-style plan: In regards to Allergic Rhinitis:
* The patient, Edrick, has a history of year-round allergic rhinitis since infancy, presenting with symptoms such as nasal congestion, runny nose, sneezing, and occasionally itchy and watery eyes, which indicates a persistent and chronic condition.
* He has been using Flonase nasal spray daily and Claritin orally, but adherence has been inconsistent, with the last dose taken a week ago; this irregular use may contribute to fluctuating symptom control.
* The treatment plan includes continuing daily use of Flonase (fluticasone propionate) one spray in each nostril and Claritin (loratadine) 10 mg orally once daily to manage symptoms effectively; adherence to this regimen is crucial for optimal control.
* Patient education will focus on the importance of consistent medication use and recognizing triggers such as seasonal changes; we will discuss environmental control measures, including keeping pets out of the bedroom and using HEPA filters to reduce allergen exposure.
* Follow-up is scheduled for Monday at 3:00 PM for comprehensive allergy testing to confirm specific allergens, including cats, dogs, and mice, and to consider initiating allergy immunotherapy (allergy shots) if appropriate.

In regards to Asthma:
* Edrick has a confirmed diagnosis of asthma, with symptoms including wheezing and difficulty breathing, particularly during illness or allergy seasons, indicating a need for better asthma management.
* He currently uses albuterol via a nebulizer as a rescue medication during exacerbations, but there is no regular controller medication in place, which may lead to uncontrolled asthma symptoms.
* The treatment plan includes continuing albuterol as needed for acute symptoms, and initiating a daily controller medication, such as Flovent (fluticasone) 44 mcg, two puffs twice daily, to prevent asthma exacerbations and improve overall lung function.
* Patient education will cover proper use of the nebulizer and inhaler, recognizing early signs of asthma exacerbations, and the importance of adhering to the controller medication regimen; we will also discuss an asthma action plan to guide management at home.
* Follow-up will be scheduled in one month to assess asthma control and adjust medications as needed; we will also review the asthma action plan and ensure the patient and family are comfortable with its implementation.

In regards to Food Intolerance:
* Edrick has a reported intolerance to milk, presenting with gastrointestinal symptoms such as diarrhea when consuming milk products, but he continues to eat dairy without severe reactions, suggesting a mild intolerance rather than a true allergy.
* Food allergy testing revealed low levels of sensitivity to eggs and almonds, but he consumes these without adverse effects, indicating these are not clinically significant allergies.
* The treatment plan includes continuing to consume milk and milk products as tolerated; if symptoms persist, consider using lactose-free products or lactase enzyme supplements to manage symptoms.
* Patient education will emphasize the difference between food intolerance and true food allergies, and the importance of monitoring symptoms after consuming dairy; we will also discuss dietary adjustments and the use of lactose-free alternatives if needed.
* Follow-up will be scheduled in three months to review any changes in symptoms and adjust dietary recommendations as necessary; we will also reassess the need for further food allergy testing if new symptoms arise.

2025-06-26 17:40:19,722 [INFO] Generated Freed-style plan: In regards to Chronic Urticaria:
* The patient has been experiencing chronic urticaria, characterized by the appearance of hives, which he describes as red, itchy, and blotchy, occurring randomly and resolving within a week, as noted during a recent episode identified as heat rash by another healthcare provider.
* To manage chronic urticaria, the patient will start a regimen of high-dose antihistamines, specifically Zyrtec (cetirizine) at a dose of 10 mg twice daily for at least two to three months to suppress the immune response and reduce the frequency and severity of hives.
* Patient education will include understanding that chronic urticaria is an immune system response and not directly related to food, drug, or environmental allergies, and that stress and viral infections like recent COVID-19 may exacerbate symptoms.
* Follow-up will be scheduled in 6 weeks to assess the effectiveness of the antihistamine therapy and to adjust the treatment plan as necessary. The patient will be encouraged to keep a symptom diary to track the frequency and severity of hives.

In regards to Angioedema:
* The patient reports episodes of angioedema, characterized by swelling in the mouth, lips, cheeks, and tongue, occurring approximately twice a month, primarily at night, and lasting several hours.
* To manage angioedema, the patient will continue using prednisone 10 mg as needed to reduce swelling when it occurs, and will also take an additional dose of Zyrtec (cetirizine) 10 mg during an episode to help alleviate symptoms.
* Patient education will focus on recognizing the signs of angioedema and the importance of carrying an EpiPen for emergency use, although it has not been needed thus far. The patient will be informed about the potential triggers such as stress and viral infections.
* Follow-up will be scheduled in 6 weeks to monitor the frequency and severity of angioedema episodes and to discuss any adjustments to the treatment plan. The patient will be advised to continue documenting episodes in the symptom diary.

In regards to Environmental Allergies:
* The patient reports some seasonal allergy symptoms such as nasal congestion and runny nose, particularly during spring and fall when spending time outdoors, suggesting possible environmental allergies.
* Comprehensive allergy testing will be performed today to identify specific environmental allergens, such as pollen, which may contribute to the patient's symptoms, although these are less likely to be the primary cause of the chronic urticaria and angioedema.
* Patient education will include understanding the difference between environmental allergies and the chronic urticaria and angioedema, and how to manage symptoms related to environmental allergens, such as using over-the-counter antihistamines like Zyrtec or Claritin during high pollen seasons.
* Follow-up will be scheduled in 6 weeks to review the results of the allergy testing and to discuss any necessary adjustments to the management of environmental allergies, including potential immunotherapy if specific allergens are identified.

2025-06-27 12:26:28,125 [INFO] Generated Freed-style plan: In regards to Urticaria:
* The patient, a 10-year-old boy, experienced a sudden onset of a severe rash characterized by urticaria a few months ago, which resolved after administration of Benadryl and Zyrtec, suggesting an acute allergic reaction.
* The urticaria recurred for two days but resolved with continued use of Zyrtec, indicating a possible environmental trigger such as grass exposure during a park visit.
* Plan to conduct comprehensive allergy testing to identify specific triggers, particularly focusing on environmental allergens like grass, and to rule out other potential causes.
* Prescribe Zyrtec 5mg daily for symptomatic relief of urticaria, with instructions to continue this regimen until allergy testing results are available.
* Educate the patient and family on avoiding known or suspected triggers, such as certain grasses, and to monitor for recurrence of symptoms.
* Schedule a follow-up appointment in 4 weeks to review allergy test results and adjust treatment plan accordingly.

In regards to Eczema:
* The patient has a history of eczema, which is common among his siblings, and presents with rashes primarily on the arms.
* Current management includes regular moisturization, which is essential for maintaining skin barrier function and reducing flare-ups.
* Plan to assess the severity of eczema during the visit and consider adding a mild topical corticosteroid, such as hydrocortisone 1% cream, to be applied twice daily to affected areas as needed.
* Recommend continued use of hypoallergenic moisturizers, such as Cetaphil or Eucerin, applied immediately after bathing to lock in moisture.
* Educate the patient and family on the importance of avoiding irritants, such as harsh soaps and detergents, and maintaining a consistent skincare routine.
* Schedule a follow-up in 3 months to evaluate the effectiveness of the current regimen and adjust as necessary.

In regards to Possible Asthma:
* The patient reports occasional shortness of breath during sports activities, which may indicate an underlying asthma component.
* Plan to conduct a full pulmonary function test (PFT) both pre- and post-bronchodilator to assess respiratory function and confirm the presence of asthma.
* If asthma is confirmed, initiate treatment with a short-acting bronchodilator, such as albuterol, to be used as needed for acute symptoms, and consider a low-dose inhaled corticosteroid, such as fluticasone 44mcg, twice daily for long-term control.
* Educate the patient and family on recognizing asthma symptoms, proper inhaler technique, and the importance of adhering to the prescribed treatment regimen.
* Schedule a follow-up appointment in 2 weeks to review PFT results and discuss the asthma management plan, with subsequent visits every 3 months to monitor control and adjust therapy as needed.

In regards to Environmental Allergies:
* The patient may have environmental allergies, particularly to grass, given the history of urticaria following a park visit.
* Plan to perform comprehensive allergy testing to identify specific environmental allergens, including grass and tree pollen, to guide targeted treatment.
* If testing confirms environmental allergies, initiate immunotherapy (allergy shots) if appropriate, starting with a build-up phase followed by maintenance doses.
* Prescribe Zyrtec 5mg daily for symptomatic relief of allergy symptoms, with instructions to continue this regimen until further assessment.
* Educate the patient and family on minimizing exposure to identified allergens, such as staying indoors during high pollen counts and using air purifiers.
* Schedule a follow-up appointment in 4 weeks to review allergy test results and discuss the initiation of immunotherapy if indicated, with subsequent visits every 3 months to monitor progress and adjust treatment as necessary.

2025-06-27 12:35:37,756 [INFO] Generated Freed-style plan: In regards to Asthma:
* Patient has a history of asthma, which is currently controlled when using prescribed medications but experiences symptoms when not adhering to the treatment regimen.
* The patient has been using Arnuity Ellipta (fluticasone furoate) 1 puff daily, which is the recommended controller medication for daily use to manage asthma symptoms and prevent exacerbations.
* For rescue therapy, the patient uses a plain albuterol inhaler as needed for acute symptoms, which is appropriate for managing sudden asthma attacks.
* The patient has been inconsistent with the use of Arnuity, taking it every other day instead of daily, which has led to suboptimal asthma control.
* It is crucial for the patient to understand the importance of daily use of Arnuity to maintain asthma control and prevent symptoms.
* The patient should rinse their mouth after using Arnuity to prevent oral thrush, a potential side effect of inhaled corticosteroids.
* The patient has been using multiple inhalers, which has caused confusion; it is essential to simplify the regimen to Arnuity daily and albuterol as needed.
* A breathing test (spirometry) is scheduled for today to assess current lung function and ensure asthma is well-controlled.
* Follow-up appointment in 3 months to review asthma control, adherence to medication, and adjust treatment if necessary.

In regards to Allergic Rhinitis:
* Patient has a history of allergic rhinitis, with a positive allergy test to dogs, though the patient's dog is kept outside, minimizing exposure.
* The patient has been using Flonase (fluticasone propionate) nasal spray, which is appropriate for managing nasal symptoms associated with allergic rhinitis.
* The recommended dosage for Flonase is 2 sprays in each nostril daily, which the patient should continue to use consistently to control symptoms.
* It is important for the patient to understand that daily use of Flonase is necessary to effectively manage allergic rhinitis symptoms.
* The patient should be educated on proper technique for using nasal spray to ensure maximum efficacy.
* The patient should monitor symptoms and report any changes or worsening of symptoms at the next follow-up.
* Follow-up appointment in 3 months to review the effectiveness of Flonase and adjust treatment if necessary.

2025-06-27 13:31:11,834 [INFO] Generated Freed-style plan: In regards to Allergic Rhinitis:
* Nicole presents with symptoms of allergic rhinitis, including nasal congestion, sneezing, and post-nasal drip, which she reports have been present year-round but have worsened recently, particularly since acquiring a new dog.
* She has been using Flonase (fluticasone propionate) nasal spray once or twice daily for the past week and Zyrtec (cetirizine) as needed, which indicates some attempt at self-management but inconsistent use of antihistamines.
* The treatment plan includes continuing Flonase at a dosage of one to two sprays in each nostril daily, as it does not interfere with upcoming allergy testing, and discontinuing Zyrtec five to seven days prior to the scheduled allergy testing on July 9th to ensure accurate test results.
* Comprehensive allergy testing will be performed on July 9th to identify specific allergens, including potential dog allergy, and to develop a targeted treatment approach, which may include allergen immunotherapy (allergy shots) if indicated.
* Patient education will focus on the importance of consistent use of nasal corticosteroids and the need to avoid antihistamines before allergy testing; follow-up will be scheduled post-testing to review results and adjust treatment as necessary.

In regards to Asthma:
* Nicole reports symptoms suggestive of asthma, including difficulty catching her breath and shortness of breath when coughing, which are associated with her allergies, and she also experiences shortness of breath when climbing stairs.
* A full breathing test (pulmonary function test) will be conducted on July 9th to assess her respiratory status and confirm the presence of asthma.
* If asthma is confirmed, treatment will be initiated with a short-acting bronchodilator such as albuterol for immediate relief of symptoms, and a controller medication such as a low-dose inhaled corticosteroid (e.g., fluticasone) will be prescribed to manage underlying inflammation.
* Patient education will include instruction on proper inhaler technique, the importance of using controller medications daily, and recognizing signs of asthma exacerbation; follow-up will be scheduled to monitor asthma control and adjust medications as needed.

2025-06-27 15:03:20,632 [INFO] Generated Freed-style plan: In regards to Eczema:
* The patient has been experiencing eczema for the past month, with symptoms primarily affecting the arms, legs, knees, and occasionally the face, indicating a need for comprehensive management to alleviate discomfort and prevent worsening.
* Current treatments include the use of hydrocortisone and triamcinolone ointment, applied twice daily, which have been somewhat effective but require optimization to address the severity and extent of the eczema.
* The treatment plan includes continuing the use of triamcinolone ointment 0.1% twice daily on affected areas for the next two weeks, followed by a reassessment to determine if a step-down to a milder steroid or non-steroidal treatment is appropriate.
* To enhance skin hydration and barrier function, the patient should apply Free and Clear cream to the entire body two to three times daily, ensuring thorough coverage to prevent dryness and flare-ups.
* Patient education will focus on the importance of consistent moisturization and adherence to the prescribed regimen, as well as avoiding triggers such as harsh soaps and detergents.
* Follow-up is scheduled in two weeks to evaluate the response to treatment and adjust the plan as necessary, with emphasis on long-term management strategies to maintain skin health.

In regards to Yeast Infection:
* The patient has been diagnosed with a yeast infection, likely contributing to the skin irritation and requiring targeted antifungal treatment to resolve.
* The current treatment involves the use of an antifungal cream, which should be continued as prescribed until the infection is fully resolved, typically within two weeks.
* The treatment plan includes applying the antifungal cream as directed, usually twice daily, ensuring complete coverage of the affected areas to eradicate the yeast.
* Patient education will emphasize the importance of completing the full course of antifungal treatment, even if symptoms improve, to prevent recurrence.
* Additionally, the patient should be advised to keep the affected areas dry and clean, and to consider using a barrier cream like diaper rash cream to protect the skin and promote healing.
* Follow-up is recommended in two weeks to confirm resolution of the yeast infection and to address any ongoing concerns or adjustments needed in the treatment plan.

2025-06-27 15:38:40,958 [INFO] Generated Freed-style plan: In regards to Peanut Allergy:
* Patient has a confirmed history of severe peanut allergy, with multiple anaphylactic reactions, the most recent in 2021 after consuming a sloppy Joe, which may have been cross-contaminated with peanuts.
* Patient experienced a severe reaction in high school after consuming a brownie containing peanuts, which led to an anaphylactic reaction treated with epinephrine, resulting in near cardiac arrest due to a high dose of epinephrine.
* Treatment plan includes continuing to avoid peanuts and peanut-containing products, and maintaining strict vigilance for cross-contamination.
* Patient will carry two EpiPens at all times, one with a .3 mg dose and another with a .5 mg dose, to be used if the first dose does not adequately control symptoms within 2-5 minutes.
* Patient education will focus on reading labels, asking about ingredients in restaurants, and understanding the risks of cross-contamination.
* Follow-up will include monitoring for any changes in reaction severity and discussing the possibility of peanut allergy testing in the future if anxiety decreases.

In regards to Tree Nut Allergy:
* Patient has not consumed tree nuts since infancy and is unsure if the allergy persists, as the last testing was 12 years ago.
* Plan to conduct skin prick testing for tree nuts including almonds, hazelnuts, cashews, pistachios, walnuts, and pecans to determine current allergic status.
* Treatment plan will be based on test results; if allergies persist, patient will continue to avoid tree nuts and carry EpiPens as prescribed for peanut allergy.
* Patient education will include understanding the difference between peanuts and tree nuts, and the importance of avoiding all tree nuts if testing confirms allergies.
* Follow-up will involve reviewing test results and adjusting the treatment plan accordingly, with potential re-testing in the future if allergies are outgrown.

In regards to Shellfish Allergy:
* Patient has never consumed shellfish and is unsure if the allergy persists, as the last testing was 12 years ago.
* Plan to conduct skin prick testing for shellfish to determine current allergic status.
* Treatment plan will be based on test results; if allergies persist, patient will continue to avoid shellfish and carry EpiPens as prescribed for peanut allergy.
* Patient education will focus on the risks of shellfish consumption and the importance of avoiding shellfish if testing confirms allergies.
* Follow-up will involve reviewing test results and adjusting the treatment plan accordingly, with potential re-testing in the future if allergies are outgrown.

In regards to Asthma:
* Patient has a history of asthma, currently managed with as-needed albuterol, which has been stable and not used for several months.
* Plan to conduct a breathing test to assess current asthma status and determine if any changes in management are necessary.
* Treatment plan includes continuing as-needed albuterol and monitoring for any changes in symptoms or frequency of use.
* Patient education will focus on recognizing asthma symptoms, proper use of inhalers, and the importance of regular follow-up.
* Follow-up will include reviewing the results of the breathing test and adjusting the asthma management plan if necessary.

In regards to Seasonal Allergies:
* Patient reports seasonal allergies, particularly worse in January, February, and March, with symptoms including runny nose and itchy eyes.
* Plan to conduct a full allergy testing for environmental allergens to identify specific triggers.
* Treatment plan includes using antihistamines as needed, such as cetirizine or loratadine, and considering nasal corticosteroids if symptoms are severe.
* Patient education will focus on understanding seasonal allergy triggers, the importance of consistent medication use during peak seasons, and strategies to minimize exposure to allergens.
* Follow-up will involve reviewing allergy test results and adjusting the treatment plan based on identified allergens and symptom severity.

In regards to Food Allergy Anxiety:
* Patient experiences significant anxiety related to food allergies, particularly peanuts, which has led to panic attacks and increased stress.
* Plan to discuss and potentially prescribe Nasolare, a new medication approved for severe food allergies, to help prevent severe anaphylactic reactions and reduce anxiety.
* Treatment plan includes initiating Nasolare in the office every two weeks, with the possibility of transitioning to home administration once stabilized.
* Patient education will focus on understanding the benefits and potential side effects of Nasolare, as well as strategies for managing anxiety related to food allergies.
* Follow-up will involve monitoring the effectiveness of Nasolare in reducing anxiety and preventing severe reactions, with adjustments to the treatment plan as needed.
