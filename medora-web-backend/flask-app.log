      "summary": "Dogs and cats have been cohabiting with us for thousands of years. They are the major human companions. Today, dogs and cats live in urban areas. Cats and most dogs are on high carbohydrate diets and face similar life-style challenges as the human beings. The health and well-being of companion animals, just as their owners, depends on the gut microbes. Providing a proper care and nutritionally balanced diet to companion animals is recognised as a part of our responsibility to maintain the health and well being of our pet. However, as microbiota differences may facilitate exposure to pathogens and harmful environmental influences, it is prudent to search for novel tools to protect dogs and cats and at the same time the human owners from pathogens. Specific probiotic strains and/or their defined combinations may be useful in the canine and feline nutrition, therapy, and care. Probiotic supplementations have been successful in the prevention and treatment of acute gastroenteritis, treatment of IBD, and prevention of allergy in companion animals. New challenges for probiotic applications include maintenance of obesity and overweight, urogenital tract infections, Helicobacter gastritis and parasitic infections. The probiotics of human origin appear to be among the new promising tools for the maintenance of pets' health. However, the host-derived microorganisms might be the most appropriate probiotic source. Therefore, more controlled trials are needed to characterise new and safe probiotic preparations with an impact on general health and well being as well as health maintenance in dogs and cats.",

      "summary": "\n Allergen vulnerability is highly individual specific. House dust mites (HDMs) are major sources of airborne allergens, found not only in houses but also detected in workplaces and most schools. The two most common HDM species from the Pyroglyphidae family, namely Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus and Dermatophagoides farinae are responsible for 90% of sensitization and allergic symptoms. Clinical conditions due to HDM allergen are rhinitis, conjunctivitis, asthma and/or atopic dermatitis (AD), and rare severe systemic reaction. Accurate diagnosis by skin prick test, specific immunoglobulin E (extract and component-based), or nasal provocation test with standardized HDM extract in contest with clinically relevant exposure to dust mites is fundamental for successful treatment. Allergen immunotherapy (AIT) is the only treatment providing sustained efficacy for moderate-to-severe allergic rhinitis, allergic asthma, and AD. This review will mainly focus on the description of HDM allergens, immunology, efficacy, and HDM-AIT (subcutaneous immunotherapy and sublingual immunotherapy).",

      "title": "Omalizumab is effective in the preseasonal treatment of seasonal allergic rhinitis",
      "summary": "Abstract Background To date no study has evaluated the efficacy of preseasonal omalizumab therapy with cost effective dose and at appropriate time point compared with standard medication in seasonal allergic rhinitis (SAR) patients. Methods This was a prospective randomized controlled open\u2010label single\u2010centre trial. 32 SAR patients were randomized to receive a single injection of omalizumab 300\u2010mg approximately two weeks before start of the pollen period (PP) or medication therapy. All patients completed daily questionnaires; recording symptoms, medication use and quality of life (QoL) throughout the observation period. The primary efficacy parameter was the mean daily Combined Symptom and Medication Score (CSMS). Results Preseasonal omalizumab significantly reduced the changes of mean daily CSMS of nose during the PP (p < 0.001), peak pollen period (PPP) and PP after PPP (PPP\u2010PP) (p = 0.002) and Post\u2010PP (p = 0.009) compared to standard medication. The proportion of allergy symptoms\u2010relieving medication\u2010free days during PPP\u2010PP was also significantly higher in preseasonal omalizumab\u2010treated group (76.2(16.7\u201098.8))% than in medication\u2010treated group (19.0(0\u201071.4))% (p = 0.030). Omalizumab could achieve the same nasal symptom control during the entire pollen season and better eye symptoms relieving results in PP (p = 0.046) and PPP\u2010PP (p = 0.004) than medication treatment. Significantly greater improvement in QoL was also obtained with omalizumab\u2010pretreatment during the PP (p = 0.037) and PPP\u2010PP (p = 0.004). Conclusions Administration of a single injection of 300 mg omalizumab two weeks before start of the pollen season achieves better overall control of symptoms and QoL, with significantly reduced allergy symptoms\u2010relieving medication usage, compared with standard pharmacotherapy in SAR patients.",

      "title": "Clarifying the effect of gut microbiota on allergic conjunctivitis risk is instrumental for predictive, preventive, and personalized medicine: a Mendelian randomization analysis",
      "summary": "Background Allergic conjunctivitis is an ocular immune disease which affects the conjunctiva, eyelids, and cornea. Growing evidence implicates the gut microbiota in balancing and modulating immunity response, and in the pathogenesis of allergic disease. As a result, gut microbial imbalance could be a useful indicator for allergic conjunctivitis. From the perspective of predictive, preventive, and personalized medicine (PPPM), clarifying the role of gut microbial imbalance in the development of allergic conjunctivitis could provide a window of opportunity for primary prediction, targeted prevention, and personalized treatment of the disease. Working hypothesis and methodology In our study, we hypothesized that individuals with microbial dysbiosis may be more susceptible to allergic conjunctivitis due to an increased inflammatory response. To verify the working hypothesis, our analysis selected genetic variants linked with gut microbiota features ( N = 18,340) and allergic conjunctivitis (4513 cases, 649,376 controls) from genome-wide association studies. The inverse-variance weighted (IVW) estimate, Mendelian randomization (MR)-Egger, weighted median estimator, maximum likelihood estimator (MLE), and MR robust adjusted profile score (MR.RAPS) were employed to analyze the impact of gut microbiota on the risk of allergic conjunctivitis and identify allergic conjunctivitis-related gut microbes. Ultimately, these findings may enable the identification of individuals at risk of allergic conjunctivitis through screening of gut microbial imbalances, and allow for new targeted prevention and personalized treatment strategies. Results Genetic liability to Ruminococcaceae_UCG_002 (OR, 0.83; 95% CI, 0.70\u20130.99; P = 4.04\u00d710^\u22122), Holdemanella (OR, 0.78; 95% CI, 0.64\u20130.96; P = 2.04\u00d710^\u22122), Catenibacterium (OR, 0.69; 95% CI, 0.56\u20130.86; P = 1.09\u00d710^\u22123), Senegalimassilia (OR, 0.71; 95% CI, 0.55\u20130.93; P = 1.23\u00d710^\u22122) genus were associated with a low risk of allergic conjunctivitis with IVW. Besides, we found suggestive associations of a genetic-driven increase in the Oscillospira (OR, 1.41; 95% CI, 1.00\u20132.00; P = 4.63\u00d710^\u22122) genus with a higher risk of allergic conjunctivitis. Moreover, MLE and MR.RAPS show consistent results with IVW after further validation and strengthened confidence in the true causal associations. No heterogeneity and pleiotropy was detected. Conclusions Our study suggests that gut microbiota may play a causal role in the development of allergic conjunctivitis and provides new insights into the microbiota-mediated mechanism of the disease. Gut microbiota may serve as a target for future predictive diagnostics, targeted prevention, and individualized therapy in allergic conjunctivitis, facilitating the transition from reactive medical services to PPPM in the management of the disease.",

      "summary": "This European Academy of Allergy and Clinical Immunology guideline provides recommendations for diagnosing IgE\u2010mediated food allergy and was developed using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluations (GRADE) approach. Food allergy diagnosis starts with an allergy\u2010focused clinical history followed by tests to determine IgE sensitization, such as serum allergen\u2010specific IgE (sIgE) and skin prick test (SPT), and the basophil activation test (BAT), if available. Evidence for IgE sensitization should be sought for any suspected foods. The diagnosis of allergy to some foods, such as peanut and cashew nut, is well supported by SPT and serum sIgE, whereas there are less data and the performance of these tests is poorer for other foods, such as wheat and soya. The measurement of sIgE to allergen components such as Ara h 2 from peanut, Cor a 14 from hazelnut and Ana o 3 from cashew can be useful to further support the diagnosis, especially in pollen\u2010sensitized individuals. BAT to peanut and sesame can be used additionally. The reference standard for food allergy diagnosis is the oral food challenge (OFC). OFC should be performed in equivocal cases. For practical reasons, open challenges are suitable in most cases. Reassessment of food allergic children with allergy tests and/or OFCs periodically over time will enable reintroduction of food into the diet in the case of spontaneous acquisition of oral tolerance.",
