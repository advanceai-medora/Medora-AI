2025-05-20 12:47:26,121 [DEBUG] PubMed article abstract: Lactose is the main source of calories in milk, an essential nutriedigestion, patients with visceral hypersensitivity nt in infancy and a key part of the diet in populations that maintain the ability to digest this disaccharide in adulthood. Lactase deficiency (LD) is the failure to express the enzyme that hydrolyses lactose into galactose and glucose in the small intestine. The genetic mechanism of lactase persistence in adult Caucasians is mediated by a single C→T nucleotide polymorphism at the LCTbo -13'910 locus on chromosome-2. Lactose malabsorption (LM) refers to any cause of failure to digest and/or absorb lactose in the small intestine. This includes primary genetic and also secondary LD due to infection or other conditions that affect the mucosal integrity of the small bowel. Lactose intolerance (LI) is defined as the onset of abdominal symptoms such as abdominal pain, bloating and diarrhoea after lactose ingestion by an individual with LM. The likelihood of LI depends on the lactose dose, lactase expression and the intestinal microbiome. Independent of lactose digestion, patients with visceral hypersensitivity associated with anxiety or the Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS) are at increased risk of the condition. Diagnostic investigations available to diagnose LM and LI include genetic, endoscopic and physiological tests. The association between self-reported LI, objective findings and clinical outcome of dietary intervention is variable. Treatment of LI can include low-lactose diet, lactase supplementation and, potentially, colonic adaptation by prebiotics. The clinical outcome of these treatments is modest, because lactose is just one of a number of poorly absorbed carbohydrates which can cause symptoms by similar mechanisms.

2025-05-20 12:47:26,121 [DEBUG] PubMed article abstract: Lactose intolerance related to primary or secondary lactase deficiency is characterized by abdominal pain and distension, borborygmi, flatus, and diarrhea induced by lactose in dairy products. The biological mechanism and lactose malabsorption is established and several investigations are available, including genetic, endoscopic and physiological tests. Lactose intolerance depends not only on the expression of lactase but also on the dose of lactose, intestinal flora, gastrointestinal motility, small intestinal bacterial overgrowth and sensitivity of the gastrointestinal tract to the generation of gas and other fermentation products of lactose digestion. Treatment of lactose intolerance can include lactose-reduced diet and enzyme replacement. This is effective if symptoms are only related to dairy products; however, lactose intolerance can be part of a wider intolerance to variably absorbed, fermentable oligo-, di-, monosaccharides and polyols (FODMAPs). This is present in at least half of patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and this group requires not only restriction of lactose intake but also a low FODMAP diet to improve gastrointestinal complaints. The long-term effects of a dairy-free, low FODMAPs diet on nutritional health and the fecal microbiome are not well defined. This review summarizes recent advances in our understanding of the genetic basis, biological mechanism, diagnosis and dietary management of lactose intolerance.

2025-05-20 12:47:27,643 [DEBUG] Semantic Scholar article title: [Benefits of using a recommended testing algorithm for the diagnosis and dietary-nutritional management of patients with chronic gastrointestinal disorders].
2025-05-20 12:47:27,644 [DEBUG] Semantic Scholar article abstract: INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVE
chronic gastrointestinal disorders such as celiac disease and lactose or fructose intolerance in adulthood are becoming more frequent and are usually accompanied by symptoms that affect daily activities and greatly limit diet. The spectrum of symptoms manifested by those affected is heterogeneous and not very specific; in addition, there is no standardized and agreed protocol for dietary management, which makes a correct diagnosis and effective treatment difficult. Disorders related to malabsorption/food intolerance can originate from primary (genetic) or secondary causes (parasites, allergies, inflammatory bowel disease, drugs, etc.). Using genetic data makes it possible to rule out or confirm primary causes, and when necessary, focus the search on secondary ones. The objective of this algorithmic approach is to guide the dietary-nutritional management of the patient with chronic gastrointestinal disease to optimize the diagnostic process and nutritional treatment.


MATERIAL AND METHODS
after a review of the literature on the pathologies most frequently associated with these disorders, a testing algorithm is proposed and the successive steps to be followed depending on the results obtained, in order to determine the diagnosis and treatment.


RESULTS
the proposed algorithm aims to be a tool for health personnel (gastroenterologists, endocrinologists, nutritionists, etc.) who care for these patients. The aim is to guide the flow of diagnostic tests based on the information provided by the patient and the clinic at the beginning, as well as to recommend the most appropriate treatment (dietary-nutritional and/or pharmacological).


CONCLUSIONS
the benefit of using an algorithmic approach is that it allows optimising the diagnostic process of primary and secondary causes, and with this, to prescribe a personalised nutritional treatment considering the origin of the disorder, to alleviate the intensity and frequency of the symptoms with the least amount of dietary restrictions possible and minimise the impact on the quality of life of the patients.

2025-05-20 12:50:32,760 [DEBUG] PubMed article title: Diagnosis and management of treatment-refractory hypothyroidism: an expert consensus report.
2025-05-20 12:50:32,760 [DEBUG] PubMed article abstract: There is a frequently encountered subset of hypothyroid patients who are refractory to standard thyroid hormone replacement treatment and require unexpectedly high doses of levothyroxine. In addition to clinical situations where hypothyroid patients are non-compliant, or where there is the possibility of excipient-induced disease exacerbation (gluten/celiac disease), therapeutic failure may be due to impaired absorption of the administered drug. The common approach to managing patients with unusual thyroxine needs is to escalate the dose of levothyroxine until targeted TSH levels are achieved. This approach can increase the risk for prolonged exposure to supratherapeutic doses of levothyroxine, which increase the chances of adverse outcomes. Repeated adjustments of levothyroxine can also escalate the costs of treatment, as frequent office visits and laboratory tests are required to determine and maintain the desired dose. Clinicians should take a systematic approach to managing patients whom they suspect of having treatment-refractory hypothyroidism. This may include searching for, and adjusting, occult medical conditions and/or other factors that may affect the absorption of levothyroxine, before up-titrating the dose of traditional levothyroxine therapy. Depending on the underlying pathology, another approach that may be considered is to try alternative formulations of levothyroxine that are less susceptible to intolerance issues related to excipients, or, in some cases, to malabsorption. The early discovery of these factors via a thoughtful patient work-up may avoid unnecessary thyroid medication adjustments and their consequences for both patients and clinicians.

2025-05-20 12:50:37,873 [DEBUG] PubMed article abstract: Major depression is one of the most prevalent and debilitating personal and public health conditions worldwide. Less appreciated is that depression's tremendous burdens are not shared equally among all who become depressed. Some will suffer recurrences over the rest of their lives, whereas half or more will never have a recurrence. Based on these two distinctive life course prototypes, we propose a subtype distinction for research on the origins and lifetime course of major depression. A pressing goal is to determine at the time of depression's first onset who will follow which clinical trajectory. The lack of recognition of this distinction has resulted in many obstacles, including conceptual biases, methodological oversights, and definitional dead ends. Current theories are reviewed and compared. The implications for contemporary diagnostic controversies, reevaluating research on treatment and prevention, and enhancing the predictive strength of traditionally weak indicators of recurrences and recurrent depression are discussed.

2025-05-20 12:50:42,655 [DEBUG] PubMed article abstract: Vitamin D and calcium have different biological functions, so the need for supplementation, and its safety and efficacy, need to be evaluated for each separately. Vitamin D deficiency is usually the result of low sunlight exposure (e.g., in frail older people, those who are veiled, those with dark-skin living at higher latitudes) and is reversible with calciferol 400-800 IU/day. Calcium supplements produce a 1% increase in bone density in the first year of use, without further increases subsequently. Vitamin D supplements do not improve bone density in clinical trials except in analyses of subgroups with baseline levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D <30 nmol/L. Supplementation with calcium, vitamin D, or their combination does not prevent fractures in community-dwelling adults, but a large study in vitamin D-deficient nursing home residents did demonstrate fracture prevention. When treating osteoporosis, co-administration of calcium with anti-resorptive drugs has not been shown to impact on treatment efficacy. Correction of severe vitamin D deficiency (<25 nmol/L) is necessary before use of potent anti-resorptive drugs to avoid hypocalcemia. Calcium supplements cause gastrointestinal side effects, particularly constipation, and increase the risk of kidney stones and, probably, heart attacks by about 20%. Low-dose vitamin D is safe, but doses >4000 IU/day have been associated with more falls and fractures. Current evidence does not support use of either calcium or vitamin D supplements in healthy community-dwelling adults.

2025-05-20 12:50:44,762 [DEBUG] Semantic Scholar article title: Vitamin D Supplementation as a Therapeutic Strategy in Autoimmune Diabetes: Insights and Implications for LADA Management
2025-05-20 12:50:44,762 [DEBUG] Semantic Scholar article abstract: Latent autoimmune diabetes of adults (LADA) is the most prevalent form of autoimmune diabetes (AI-D) in adulthood; however, its accurate diagnosis and optimal treatment remain challenging. Vitamin D deficiency (VDD) is commonly observed in LADA patients, while increased vitamin D exposure through supplementation and dietary intake is associated with a reduced incidence of LADA. Although limited, case reports, case-control studies, and randomized clinical trials have examined the effects of vitamin D supplementation—alone or combined with dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors (DPP4-is)—on glucose regulation, residual β-cell function, and glutamic acid decarboxylase antibody (GADA65) levels. Findings, while preliminary, indicate that vitamin D supplementation may enhance glycemic control, preserve β-cell function, and reduce autoimmune activity. Given its accessibility, affordability, and relative safety, vitamin D supplementation presents an attractive adjunct treatment option for LADA patients. This narrative review discusses current evidence on the potential therapeutic benefits of vitamin D supplementation in patients with AI-D, including LADA, who are also vitamin D deficient. Beginning with an exploration of the epidemiological patterns, clinical presentation, and diagnostic framework essential for understanding and identifying LADA, this review then examines the proposed mechanisms through which vitamin D may influence autoimmune modulation of pancreatic β-cells, integrating recent data pertinent to LADA pathology. By distilling and consolidating existing research, we aim to provide a platform for advancing targeted investigations within this distinct patient population.

2025-05-20 12:50:51,647 [DEBUG] Semantic Scholar article abstract: Abstract Background There are many pharmacologic therapies that are being used or considered for treatment of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), with rapidly changing efficacy and safety evidence from trials. Objective Develop evidence-based, rapid, living guidelines intended to support patients, clinicians, and other healthcare professionals in their decisions about treatment and management of patients with COVID-19. Methods In March 2020, the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) formed a multidisciplinary guideline panel of infectious disease clinicians, pharmacists, and methodologists with varied areas of expertise to regularly review the evidence and make recommendations about the treatment and management of persons with COVID-19. The process used a living guideline approach and followed a rapid recommendation development checklist. The panel prioritized questions and outcomes. A systematic review of the peer-reviewed and grey literature was conducted at regular intervals. The Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach was used to assess the certainty of evidence and make recommendations. Results Based on the most recent search conducted on May 31, 2022, the IDSA guideline panel has made 30 recommendations for the treatment and management of the following groups/populations: pre- and post-exposure prophylaxis, ambulatory with mild-to-moderate disease, hospitalized with mild-to-moderate, severe but not critical, and critical disease. As these are living guidelines, the most recent recommendations can be found online at: https://idsociety.org/COVID19guidelines. Conclusions At the inception of its work, the panel has expressed the overarching goal that patients be recruited into ongoing trials. Since then, many trials were done which provided much needed evidence for COVID-19 therapies. There still remain many unanswered questions as the pandemic evolved which we hope future trials can answer.

The Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach was used to assess the certainty of evidence and make recommendations. Results Based on the most recent search conducted on May 31, 2022, the IDSA guideline panel has made 30 recommendations for the treatment and management of the following groups/populations: pre- and post-exposure prophylaxis, ambulatory with mild-to-moderate disease, hospitalized with mild-to-moderate, severe but not critical, and critical disease. As these are living guidelines, the most recent recommendations can be found online at: https://idsociety.org/COVID19guidelines. Conclusions At the inception of its work, the panel has expressed the overarching goal that patients be recruited into ongoing trials. Since then, many trials were done which provided much needed evidence for COVID-19 therapies. There still remain many unanswered questions as the pandemic evolved which we hope future trials can answer.', 'url': 'https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/42d550042e2cd4248cf9f7723c1db57c72a11803', 'authors': 'A.

In addition to clinical situations where hypothyroid patients are non-compliant, or where there is the possibility of excipient-induced disease exacerbation (gluten/celiac disease), therapeutic failure may be due to impaired absorption of the administered drug. The common approach to managing patients with unusual thyroxine needs is to escalate the dose of levothyroxine until targeted TSH levels are achieved. This approach can increase the risk for prolonged exposure to supratherapeutic doses of levothyroxine, which increase the chances of adverse outcomes. Repeated adjustments of levothyroxine can also escalate the costs of treatment, as frequent office visits and laboratory tests are required to determine and maintain the desired dose. Clinicians should take a systematic approach to managing patients whom they suspect of having treatment-refractory hypothyroidism. This may include searching for, and adjusting, occult medical conditions and/or other factors that may affect the absorption of levothyroxine, before up-titrating the dose of traditional levothyroxine therapy. Depending on the underlying pathology, another approach that may be considered is to try alternative formulations of levothyroxine that are less susceptible to intolerance issues related to excipients, or, in some cases, to malabsorption. The early discovery of these factors via a thoughtful patient work-up may avoid unnecessary thyroid medication adjustments and their consequences for both patients and clinicians.', 'pubmed_id': '28695483', 'url': 'https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28695483/', 'confidence': 'Recommended', 'relevance_score': '55.0%', 'relevance_tag': 'Relevant to hypothyroidism exacerbation', 'source': 'PubMed', 'authors': 'M Centanni, S Benvenga, I Sachmechi', 'year': '2017', 'raw_relevance_score': 55.00000000000001}, {'title': 'Team Up!', 'summary': 'N/A', 'pubmed_id': '28385316', 'url': 'https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28385316/', 'confidence': 'Highly Recommended', 'relevance_score': '100.0%', 'relevance_tag': 'Relevant to hypothyroidism exacerbation', 'source': 'PubMed', 'authors': 'Mary Norine Walsh', 'year': '2017', 'raw_relevance_score': 100}, {'title': "Canadian Network for Mood and Anxiety Treatments (CANMAT) 2023 Update on Clinical Guidelines for Management of Major Depressive Disorder in Adults: Réseau canadien pour les traitements de l'humeur et de l'anxiété (CANMAT) 2023 : Mise à jour des lignes directrices cliniques pour la prise en charge du trouble dépressif majeur chez les adultes.", 'summary': 'The Canadian Network for Mood and Anxiety Treatments (CANMAT) last published clinical guidelines for the management of major depressive disorder (MDD) in 2016.

Vitamin D deficiency is usually the result of low sunlight exposure (e.g., in frail older people, those who are veiled, those with dark-skin living at higher latitudes) and is reversible with calciferol 400-800 IU/day. Calcium supplements produce a 1% increase in bone density in the first year of use, without further increases subsequently. Vitamin D supplements do not improve bone density in clinical trials except in analyses of subgroups with baseline levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D <30 nmol/L. Supplementation with calcium, vitamin D, or their combination does not prevent fractures in community-dwelling adults, but a large study in vitamin D-deficient nursing home residents did demonstrate fracture prevention. When treating osteoporosis, co-administration of calcium with anti-resorptive drugs has not been shown to impact on treatment efficacy. Correction of severe vitamin D deficiency (<25 nmol/L) is necessary before use of potent anti-resorptive drugs to avoid hypocalcemia. Calcium supplements cause gastrointestinal side effects, particularly constipation, and increase the risk of kidney stones and, probably, heart attacks by about 20%.

Vitamin D deficiency (VDD) is commonly observed in LADA patients, while increased vitamin D exposure through supplementation and dietary intake is associated with a reduced incidence of LADA. Although limited, case reports, case-control studies, and randomized clinical trials have examined the effects of vitamin D supplementation—alone or combined with dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors (DPP4-is)—on glucose regulation, residual β-cell function, and glutamic acid decarboxylase antibody (GADA65) levels. Findings, while preliminary, indicate that vitamin D supplementation may enhance glycemic control, preserve β-cell function, and reduce autoimmune activity. Given its accessibility, affordability, and relative safety, vitamin D supplementation presents an attractive adjunct treatment option for LADA patients. This narrative review discusses current evidence on the potential therapeutic benefits of vitamin D supplementation in patients with AI-D, including LADA, who are also vitamin D deficient. Beginning with an exploration of the epidemiological patterns, clinical presentation, and diagnostic framework essential for understanding and identifying LADA, this review then examines the proposed mechanisms through which vitamin D may influence autoimmune modulation of pancreatic β-cells, integrating recent data pertinent to LADA pathology.

Any new problems or concerns?\n\nHonestly, I’ve been feeling pretty tired lately. Sometimes I get short of breath when I’m just doing light chores around the house.\n\nI see. Have you noticed any chest pain or dizziness with those episodes?\n\nNo chest pain, but sometimes I feel a bit light-headed.\n\nOkay. Last time, your labs showed your blood sugar was a bit high. Have you been checking your blood sugars at home?\n\nYes, I check them every morning. They’ve been mostly okay, but my doctor said my A1c was up a bit—around 7.8%. I’m trying to watch my diet better.\n\nGood to hear you’re monitoring. Are you still taking your metformin and lisinopril as prescribed?\n\nYes, I take metformin 500 mg twice a day and lisinopril 20 mg once daily. Also, I’ve been on atorvastatin for cholesterol.\n\nAny side effects from those medications?\n\nNo side effects. I feel fine on them.\n\nDo you have any allergies to medications or anything else?\n\nNo allergies to meds that I know of. I do get seasonal allergies sometimes, and I take over-the-counter antihistamines when needed.\n\nHow about your daily routine? Any exercise or diet changes?\n\nI try to walk for about 30 minutes most days. I’m also sticking to a low-sodium, diabetic-friendly diet like we discussed.\n\nThat’s great. Stress can affect your blood pressure and sugar—how are you managing stress?\n\nThat’s been tough. I’ve been feeling more stressed lately with work and home stuff.\n\nOkay, we can talk about some ways to manage that too. For now, we’ll check your blood pressure and labs again soon and adjust medications if needed.\n\n    Ensure all medical terms are accurate and contextualized for a professional allergist. Include specific details (e.g., medication names with exact dosages, test types). Avoid speculative diagnoses; flag uncertainty for human review. For the enhanced_recommendations section, be exceptionally thorough and specific, providing detailed actionable insights based on current clinical guidelines and evidence-based best practices. Include precise timelines and measurable outcomes where appropriate.\n\n    Output in JSON format:\n    {\n        "patient_history": {\n            "chief_complaint": "string",\n            "history_of_present_illness": "string",\n            "past_medical_history": "string",\n            "allergies": "string",\n            "social_history": "string",\n            "review_of_systems": "string"\n        },\n        "physical_examination": "string",\n        "differential_diagnosis": "string",\n        "diagnostic_workup": "string",\n        "plan_of_care": "string",\n        "patient_education": "string",\n        "follow_up_instructions": "string",\n        "summary": "string",\n        "enhanced_recommendations": "string"\n    }\n    '}], 'max_tokens': 2500, 'temperature': 0.25}

Tell me, what\'s been going on?"\n"Morning, Dr. Ellis. It\'s… it\'s a lot. For the past six, maybe eight months, I\'ve been feeling this overwhelming fatigue. Not just tired, Doctor, but like my bones are made of lead. And I\'ve been getting these strange rashes, mostly on my arms and chest. They come and go, sometimes itchy, sometimes just red patches. My wife noticed I\'ve been more short of breath lately too, especially when I climb the stairs. And then there are the joint pains – my knees, my wrists, sometimes my fingers. They’re stiff in the morning, and they ache pretty much all day. I\'ve also had a couple of episodes where I felt like my heart was racing, just out of the blue, even when I was sitting down. Oh, and I\'ve lost a bit of weight without trying, maybe ten pounds."\n"Okay, Mr. Harrison, that is quite a constellation of symptoms. Let\'s break this down. The fatigue, you said it\'s debilitating?"\n"Yes, absolutely. I used to be quite active, but now even a short walk feels like a marathon."\n"And the rashes – can you describe them a bit more? Are they raised? Scaly?"\n"Sometimes they’re slightly raised, other times flat. Not really scaly, more like… blotchy. And they seem to worsen after I\'ve been out in the sun, even for a short while."\n"Sun sensitivity, noted. The shortness of breath – is it accompanied by any chest pain or wheezing?"\n"No distinct chest pain when I\'m breathless, more like a tightness. No wheezing that I\'ve noticed."\n"And the joint pain – is it symmetrical, meaning it affects both sides, say both knees or both wrists, fairly equally?"\n"Yes, I\'d say so. When my right knee flares up, the left one isn\'t far behind. Same with my hands."\n"Have you noticed any swelling in the joints?"\n"Yes, sometimes my fingers and knuckles look a bit puffy, especially in the morning."\n"Alright. And the heart palpitations – how long do those episodes last? Any dizziness or fainting associated with them?"\n"They can last a few minutes, maybe up to ten. I do feel a bit lightheaded during them, but I haven\'t fainted."\n"Any other symptoms? Fevers? Swollen glands? Mouth sores? Hair loss?"\n"Now that you mention it, I have had a couple of mouth ulcers that were quite painful. And my hair seems thinner than it used to be, but I just put that down to getting older."\n"Okay, Mr. Harrison. Based on what you\'re describing – the multisystem involvement including the skin, joints, fatigue, shortness of breath, and photosensitivity, along with the mouth ulcers and possible hair thinning – we need to consider a few possibilities. One of the conditions that comes to mind, given this pattern, is an autoimmune process, something like systemic lupus erythematosus, or SLE. This is a condition where the body\'s immune system mistakenly attacks its own healthy tissues and organs. It can affect many different parts of the body, which would explain the wide range of symptoms you\'re experiencing."\n"Lupus? I\'ve heard of it. That sounds serious."\n"It can be, but it\'s also a manageable condition for many people. The key is getting an accurate diagnosis and starting appropriate treatment. The symptoms you\'re describing, such as the malar rash or butterfly rash which can be sun-sensitive, the arthritis, pleuritis or pericarditis which could explain the shortness of breath and palpitations, and the hematologic and neurologic aspects we haven’t fully explored yet, are all potential criteria. To investigate this further, I\'d like to order a series of blood tests. We\'ll need to look for specific autoantibodies, like an ANA, or antinuclear antibody, anti-dsDNA, and anti-Smith antibodies, which are often present in SLE. We\'ll also check your inflammatory markers, kidney and liver function, and a complete blood count. Depending on those results, we might also consider imaging, perhaps a chest X-ray or an echocardiogram to assess your heart and lungs more closely. It’s important we rule out other conditions as well, such as rheumatoid arthritis, Sjogren’s syndrome, or even certain infections that can mimic these symptoms, though the constellation you present is quite suggestive. For now, I want you to keep a detailed symptom diary – note any new rashes, joint pain flare-ups, episodes of breathlessness or palpitations, and any potential triggers you notice, especially sun exposure. This will be very helpful as we move forward."\n"Okay, Doctor. That\'s a lot to take in. So, blood tests first."\n"Yes. We\'ll get those drawn today if you have the time. We need to gather more information to piece this puzzle together. It\'s a complex picture, Mr. Harrison, but we\'ll work through it systematically."\n"I appreciate that, Dr. Ellis. Thank you."\n"You\'re welcome. We\'ll schedule a follow-up to discuss the results as soon as they\'re available. My nurse will give you the lab forms and help you with scheduling."\n\n    Ensure all medical terms are accurate and contextualized for a professional allergist. Include specific details (e.g., medication names with exact dosages, test types). Avoid speculative diagnoses; flag uncertainty for human review. For the enhanced_recommendations section, be exceptionally thorough and specific, providing detailed actionable insights based on current clinical guidelines and evidence-based best practices. Include precise timelines and measurable outcomes where appropriate.\n\n    Output in JSON format:\n    {\n        "patient_history": {\n            "chief_complaint": "string",\n            "history_of_present_illness": "string",\n            "past_medical_history": "string",\n            "allergies": "string",\n            "social_history": "string",\n            "review_of_systems": "string"\n        },\n        "physical_examination": "string",\n        "differential_diagnosis": "string",\n        "diagnostic_workup": "string",\n        "plan_of_care": "string",\n        "patient_education": "string",\n        "follow_up_instructions": "string",\n        "summary": "string",\n        "enhanced_recommendations": "string"\n    }\n    '}], 'max_tokens': 2500, 'temperature': 0.25}

Tell me, what\'s been going on?"\n"Morning, Dr. Ellis. It\'s… it\'s a lot. For the past six, maybe eight months, I\'ve been feeling this overwhelming fatigue. Not just tired, Doctor, but like my bones are made of lead. And I\'ve been getting these strange rashes, mostly on my arms and chest. They come and go, sometimes itchy, sometimes just red patches. My wife noticed I\'ve been more short of breath lately too, especially when I climb the stairs. And then there are the joint pains – my knees, my wrists, sometimes my fingers. They’re stiff in the morning, and they ache pretty much all day. I\'ve also had a couple of episodes where I felt like my heart was racing, just out of the blue, even when I was sitting down. Oh, and I\'ve lost a bit of weight without trying, maybe ten pounds."\n"Okay, Mr. Harrison, that is quite a constellation of symptoms. Let\'s break this down. The fatigue, you said it\'s debilitating?"\n"Yes, absolutely. I used to be quite active, but now even a short walk feels like a marathon."\n"And the rashes – can you describe them a bit more? Are they raised? Scaly?"\n"Sometimes they’re slightly raised, other times flat. Not really scaly, more like… blotchy. And they seem to worsen after I\'ve been out in the sun, even for a short while."\n"Sun sensitivity, noted. The shortness of breath – is it accompanied by any chest pain or wheezing?"\n"No distinct chest pain when I\'m breathless, more like a tightness. No wheezing that I\'ve noticed."\n"And the joint pain – is it symmetrical, meaning it affects both sides, say both knees or both wrists, fairly equally?"\n"Yes, I\'d say so. When my right knee flares up, the left one isn\'t far behind. Same with my hands."\n"Have you noticed any swelling in the joints?"\n"Yes, sometimes my fingers and knuckles look a bit puffy, especially in the morning."\n"Alright. And the heart palpitations – how long do those episodes last? Any dizziness or fainting associated with them?"\n"They can last a few minutes, maybe up to ten. I do feel a bit lightheaded during them, but I haven\'t fainted."\n"Any other symptoms? Fevers? Swollen glands? Mouth sores? Hair loss?"\n"Now that you mention it, I have had a couple of mouth ulcers that were quite painful. And my hair seems thinner than it used to be, but I just put that down to getting older."\n"Okay, Mr. Harrison. Based on what you\'re describing – the multisystem involvement including the skin, joints, fatigue, shortness of breath, and photosensitivity, along with the mouth ulcers and possible hair thinning – we need to consider a few possibilities. One of the conditions that comes to mind, given this pattern, is an autoimmune process, something like systemic lupus erythematosus, or SLE. This is a condition where the body\'s immune system mistakenly attacks its own healthy tissues and organs. It can affect many different parts of the body, which would explain the wide range of symptoms you\'re experiencing."\n"Lupus? I\'ve heard of it. That sounds serious."\n"It can be, but it\'s also a manageable condition for many people. The key is getting an accurate diagnosis and starting appropriate treatment. The symptoms you\'re describing, such as the malar rash or butterfly rash which can be sun-sensitive, the arthritis, pleuritis or pericarditis which could explain the shortness of breath and palpitations, and the hematologic and neurologic aspects we haven’t fully explored yet, are all potential criteria. To investigate this further, I\'d like to order a series of blood tests. We\'ll need to look for specific autoantibodies, like an ANA, or antinuclear antibody, anti-dsDNA, and anti-Smith antibodies, which are often present in SLE. We\'ll also check your inflammatory markers, kidney and liver function, and a complete blood count. Depending on those results, we might also consider imaging, perhaps a chest X-ray or an echocardiogram to assess your heart and lungs more closely. It’s important we rule out other conditions as well, such as rheumatoid arthritis, Sjogren’s syndrome, or even certain infections that can mimic these symptoms, though the constellation you present is quite suggestive. For now, I want you to keep a detailed symptom diary – note any new rashes, joint pain flare-ups, episodes of breathlessness or palpitations, and any potential triggers you notice, especially sun exposure. This will be very helpful as we move forward."\n"Okay, Doctor. That\'s a lot to take in. So, blood tests first."\n"Yes. We\'ll get those drawn today if you have the time. We need to gather more information to piece this puzzle together. It\'s a complex picture, Mr. Harrison, but we\'ll work through it systematically."\n"I appreciate that, Dr. Ellis. Thank you."\n"You\'re welcome. We\'ll schedule a follow-up to discuss the results as soon as they\'re available. My nurse will give you the lab forms and help you with scheduling."\n\n    Ensure all medical terms are accurate and contextualized for a professional allergist. Include specific details (e.g., medication names with exact dosages, test types). Avoid speculative diagnoses; flag uncertainty for human review. For the enhanced_recommendations section, be exceptionally thorough and specific, providing detailed actionable insights based on current clinical guidelines and evidence-based best practices. Include precise timelines and measurable outcomes where appropriate.\n\n    Output in JSON format:\n    {\n        "patient_history": {\n            "chief_complaint": "string",\n            "history_of_present_illness": "string",\n            "past_medical_history": "string",\n            "allergies": "string",\n            "social_history": "string",\n            "review_of_systems": "string"\n        },\n        "physical_examination": "string",\n        "differential_diagnosis": "string",\n        "diagnostic_workup": "string",\n        "plan_of_care": "string",\n        "patient_education": "string",\n        "follow_up_instructions": "string",\n        "summary": "string",\n        "enhanced_recommendations": "string"\n    }\n    '}], 'max_tokens': 2500, 'temperature': 0.25}

Measurable outcomes include reduced fatigue, decreased joint pain, and fewer rash episodes.\n   - Future treatment options: Consider biologics such as belimumab for SLE if symptoms persist despite initial treatment.\n   - Criteria for success/failure: Success is defined as a 50% reduction in symptom severity and no flares for 6 months. Failure is defined as no improvement after 6 months of treatment.\n   - Specialized referrals: Refer to a rheumatologist if symptoms suggest rheumatoid arthritis or if SLE management becomes complex.\n\n6. Patient Education Resources:\n   - Educational materials: 'Understanding Lupus' by the Lupus Foundation of America, 'Living Well with Rheumatoid Arthritis' by the Arthritis Foundation.\n   - Support groups: Local lupus support groups (contact information to be provided by the clinic).\n   - Online resources: Lupus.org, Arthritis.org, and MayoClinic.org for reliable information on autoimmune conditions.\n   - Mobile applications: 'MySymptoms' for tracking symptoms and 'Medisafe' for medication reminders.\n\n7. Follow-up Schedule:\n   - Timing: Follow-up appointment in 2 weeks to review blood test results, then every 3 months for ongoing management.\n   - Tests before next visit: None required before the 2-week follow-up, but consider repeat blood tests at 3-month intervals.\n   - Information to bring: Symptom diary, list of current medications, and any new symptoms or concerns.\n   - Treatment milestones: Aim for a 50% reduction in symptom severity within 3 months, and no flares for 6 months as a long-term goal.",
  "recommendations": "1. Medication Management:\n   - Hydroxychloroquine: 200 mg orally once daily. Rationale: Effective in managing symptoms and preventing flares in SLE. Monitor for potential side effects such as retinal toxicity with annual eye exams.\n   - Prednisone: 5-10 mg daily if symptoms are severe, with a plan to taper as soon as possible. Rationale: Provides rapid symptom relief but long-term use should be avoided due to side effects.\n   - Methotrexate: 15 mg weekly with folic acid supplementation. Rationale: Effective for managing joint symptoms in rheumatoid arthritis. Monitor for liver function and blood counts.\n   - Artificial tears and saliva substitutes: As needed for Sjogren's Syndrome. Rationale: Provides symptomatic relief for dry eyes and mouth.\n   - Medication interactions: Hydroxychloroquine can interact with digoxin and antacids; methotrexate can interact with NSAIDs and certain antibiotics. Monitor closely.\n   - Adjustment protocol: Increase hydroxychloroquine to 400 mg daily if symptoms persist after 3 months. Adjust prednisone based on symptom severity, aiming to taper within 6-8 weeks.\n\n2. Lifestyle Modifications:\n   - Environmental controls: Use high SPF sunscreen, wear protective clothing, and avoid direct sunlight to prevent rash exacerbations.\n   - Trigger avoidance: Identify and avoid potential triggers such as stress, infections, and certain medications that can exacerbate autoimmune conditions.\n   - Dietary adjustments: No specific dietary restrictions, but encourage a balanced diet rich in anti-inflammatory foods like omega-3 fatty acids.\n   - Exercise: Encourage low-impact exercises like swimming or walking to maintain joint mobility and overall health, but avoid overexertion.\n   - Stress management: Implement relaxation techniques such as meditation, yoga, or deep breathing exercises to manage stress, which can trigger flares.\n\n3. Monitoring Protocol:\n   - Parameters to monitor: Fatigue, rash severity, joint pain, shortness of breath, heart palpitations, and any new symptoms.\n   - Frequency and method: Daily symptom diary, weekly review of symptoms, and monthly vital sign checks (blood pressure, heart rate).\n   - Thresholds for contact: Contact healthcare provider if symptoms worsen, new severe symptoms develop, or if there is no improvement after 4 weeks of treatment.\n   - Recommended tools: Use a digital symptom tracker app or a physical diary to record symptoms and triggers.\n   - Documentation approach: Maintain a detailed symptom diary, including date, time, severity, and potential triggers.\n\n4. Emergency Action Plan:\n   - Acute exacerbations: If experiencing severe shortness of breath, chest pain, or severe joint pain, take a dose of prednisone (e.g., 40 mg) and seek immediate medical attention.\n   - Indicators for emergency care: Severe symptoms such as chest pain, difficulty breathing, or sudden severe joint swelling.\n   - Emergency medication: Prednisone 40 mg orally for acute exacerbations, to be used only in emergencies.\n   - Instructions for caregivers: Monitor for signs of severe symptoms and assist in seeking emergency care if necessary.\n\n5.

2025-05-20 13:06:47,439 [DEBUG] Semantic Scholar article abstract: Vitiated Vata Dosha, weakened Agni, and accumulation of Ama at Shleshmic Sthana mainly at Sandhi (joints) are responsible for the development of Aamvata. Amavata can be correlated with Rheumatoid Arthritis due to similarities in clinical symtoms. Rheumatoid arthritis is one among the autoimmune diseases causing chronic symmetrical polyarthritis. The treatment in Modern science includes the use of NSAID’s (Non steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs), DMARD’s (Disease-Modifying Antirheumatic Drugs), glucocorticoids, and immune-suppressants, long-term use of which causes several side effects. Ayurveda treatment procedures and medication used for the treatment of Amavata have Agni Deepana, Ama Pachana, Vata Shamaka, Sroto shodhana actions which are helpful to retard disease process and reduce signs and symptoms of the disease. In the present case, 65-year female patient presented with, complaints of multiple joint pain with swelling and morning stiffness, restricted joint movements, loss of appetite, fatigue, weakness, fever (on and off), migratory pain, and symmetrical joint involvement. Patient was administered with Phalatrikadiguggulu, Shwadanshtradi guggulu. Mahayograjguggulu, Rasapachak vati, Sameerpannag rasa and Gandharvaharitaki churna added as Nitya Virechana. Ruksha Swedan with Valukapottali had also been given. The therapeutic interventions adopted in the study have shown beneficial effects in the patients of Aamvata.

The treatment in Modern science includes the use of NSAID’s (Non steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs), DMARD’s (Disease-Modifying Antirheumatic Drugs), glucocorticoids, and immune-suppressants, long-term use of which causes several side effects. Ayurveda treatment procedures and medication used for the treatment of Amavata have Agni Deepana, Ama Pachana, Vata Shamaka, Sroto shodhana actions which are helpful to retard disease process and reduce signs and symptoms of the disease.

Tell me, what\'s been going on?"\n"Morning, Dr. Ellis. It\'s… it\'s a lot. For the past six, maybe eight months, I\'ve been feeling this overwhelming fatigue. Not just tired, Doctor, but like my bones are made of lead. And I\'ve been getting these strange rashes, mostly on my arms and chest. They come and go, sometimes itchy, sometimes just red patches. My wife noticed I\'ve been more short of breath lately too, especially when I climb the stairs. And then there are the joint pains – my knees, my wrists, sometimes my fingers. They’re stiff in the morning, and they ache pretty much all day. I\'ve also had a couple of episodes where I felt like my heart was racing, just out of the blue, even when I was sitting down. Oh, and I\'ve lost a bit of weight without trying, maybe ten pounds."\n"Okay, Mr. Harrison, that is quite a constellation of symptoms. Let\'s break this down. The fatigue, you said it\'s debilitating?"\n"Yes, absolutely. I used to be quite active, but now even a short walk feels like a marathon."\n"And the rashes – can you describe them a bit more? Are they raised? Scaly?"\n"Sometimes they’re slightly raised, other times flat. Not really scaly, more like… blotchy. And they seem to worsen after I\'ve been out in the sun, even for a short while."\n"Sun sensitivity, noted. The shortness of breath – is it accompanied by any chest pain or wheezing?"\n"No distinct chest pain when I\'m breathless, more like a tightness. No wheezing that I\'ve noticed."\n"And the joint pain – is it symmetrical, meaning it affects both sides, say both knees or both wrists, fairly equally?"\n"Yes, I\'d say so. When my right knee flares up, the left one isn\'t far behind. Same with my hands."\n"Have you noticed any swelling in the joints?"\n"Yes, sometimes my fingers and knuckles look a bit puffy, especially in the morning."\n"Alright. And the heart palpitations – how long do those episodes last? Any dizziness or fainting associated with them?"\n"They can last a few minutes, maybe up to ten. I do feel a bit lightheaded during them, but I haven\'t fainted."\n"Any other symptoms? Fevers? Swollen glands? Mouth sores? Hair loss?"\n"Now that you mention it, I have had a couple of mouth ulcers that were quite painful. And my hair seems thinner than it used to be, but I just put that down to getting older."\n"Okay, Mr. Harrison. Based on what you\'re describing – the multisystem involvement including the skin, joints, fatigue, shortness of breath, and photosensitivity, along with the mouth ulcers and possible hair thinning – we need to consider a few possibilities. One of the conditions that comes to mind, given this pattern, is an autoimmune process, something like systemic lupus erythematosus, or SLE. This is a condition where the body\'s immune system mistakenly attacks its own healthy tissues and organs. It can affect many different parts of the body, which would explain the wide range of symptoms you\'re experiencing."\n"Lupus? I\'ve heard of it. That sounds serious."\n"It can be, but it\'s also a manageable condition for many people. The key is getting an accurate diagnosis and starting appropriate treatment. The symptoms you\'re describing, such as the malar rash or butterfly rash which can be sun-sensitive, the arthritis, pleuritis or pericarditis which could explain the shortness of breath and palpitations, and the hematologic and neurologic aspects we haven’t fully explored yet, are all potential criteria. To investigate this further, I\'d like to order a series of blood tests. We\'ll need to look for specific autoantibodies, like an ANA, or antinuclear antibody, anti-dsDNA, and anti-Smith antibodies, which are often present in SLE. We\'ll also check your inflammatory markers, kidney and liver function, and a complete blood count. Depending on those results, we might also consider imaging, perhaps a chest X-ray or an echocardiogram to assess your heart and lungs more closely. It’s important we rule out other conditions as well, such as rheumatoid arthritis, Sjogren’s syndrome, or even certain infections that can mimic these symptoms, though the constellation you present is quite suggestive. For now, I want you to keep a detailed symptom diary – note any new rashes, joint pain flare-ups, episodes of breathlessness or palpitations, and any potential triggers you notice, especially sun exposure. This will be very helpful as we move forward."\n"Okay, Doctor. That\'s a lot to take in. So, blood tests first."\n"Yes. We\'ll get those drawn today if you have the time. We need to gather more information to piece this puzzle together. It\'s a complex picture, Mr. Harrison, but we\'ll work through it systematically."\n"I appreciate that, Dr. Ellis. Thank you."\n"You\'re welcome. We\'ll schedule a follow-up to discuss the results as soon as they\'re available. My nurse will give you the lab forms and help you with scheduling."\n\n    Ensure all medical terms are accurate and contextualized for a professional allergist. Include specific details (e.g., medication names with exact dosages, test types). Avoid speculative diagnoses; flag uncertainty for human review. For the enhanced_recommendations section, be exceptionally thorough and specific, providing detailed actionable insights based on current clinical guidelines and evidence-based best practices. Include precise timelines and measurable outcomes where appropriate.\n\n    Output in JSON format:\n    {\n        "patient_history": {\n            "chief_complaint": "string",\n            "history_of_present_illness": "string",\n            "past_medical_history": "string",\n            "allergies": "string",\n            "social_history": "string",\n            "review_of_systems": "string"\n        },\n        "physical_examination": "string",\n        "differential_diagnosis": "string",\n        "diagnostic_workup": "string",\n        "plan_of_care": "string",\n        "patient_education": "string",\n        "follow_up_instructions": "string",\n        "summary": "string",\n        "enhanced_recommendations": "string"\n    }\n    '}], 'max_tokens': 2500, 'temperature': 0.25}

Rationale: NSAIDs provide symptomatic relief for joint pain and inflammation.\\n   - Methotrexate 15 mg orally once weekly with folic acid supplementation if Rheumatoid Arthritis is confirmed. Rationale: Methotrexate is a disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD) used to slow the progression of RA.\\n   - Artificial tears and saliva substitutes for Sjogren's Syndrome. Rationale: These provide symptomatic relief for dry eyes and mouth.\\n   - Medication interactions: Monitor for potential interactions between hydroxychloroquine and other medications, especially those affecting the heart or liver.\\n   - Adjustment protocol: Increase hydroxychloroquine to 400 mg daily if symptoms persist after 3 months, under close monitoring for retinal toxicity. Adjust NSAID dosage based on pain relief and gastrointestinal tolerance.\\n\\n2. Lifestyle Modifications:\\n   - Implement strict sun protection measures: Use broad-spectrum sunscreen with SPF 30 or higher, wear protective clothing, and avoid peak sun hours.\\n   - Avoid known triggers: Keep a detailed diary to identify and avoid triggers such as sun exposure, stress, or certain foods.\\n   - Dietary adjustments: Consider a balanced diet rich in anti-inflammatory foods like omega-3 fatty acids, and avoid processed foods and high sugar intake.\\n   - Exercise: Engage in low-impact exercises like swimming or walking, avoiding overexertion which may exacerbate symptoms.\\n   - Stress management: Practice mindfulness, meditation, or yoga to manage stress, which can trigger flares.\\n\\n3. Monitoring Protocol:\\n   - Monitor symptoms daily, noting any new rashes, joint pain, shortness of breath, or palpitations.\\n   - Check vital signs at home, including blood pressure and heart rate, especially during symptomatic episodes.\\n   - Contact healthcare provider if symptoms worsen or new symptoms appear, particularly severe shortness of breath, chest pain, or significant joint swelling.\\n   - Use a symptom diary or digital tracking app to document symptoms and potential triggers.\\n   - Consider a home blood pressure monitor and a pulse oximeter for monitoring.\\n\\n4. Emergency Action Plan:\\n   - In case of severe shortness of breath, chest pain, or significant joint swelling, seek immediate emergency care.\\n   - For acute joint pain, use prescribed NSAIDs as directed and rest the affected joints.\\n   - If experiencing severe palpitations or lightheadedness, sit or lie down, and call emergency services if symptoms persist.\\n   - Educate family members on recognizing severe symptoms and the need for immediate medical attention.\\n\\n5.

2025-05-20 13:07:44,144 [DEBUG] Semantic Scholar article abstract: Vitiated Vata Dosha, weakened Agni, and accumulation of Ama at Shleshmic Sthana mainly at Sandhi (joints) are responsible for the development of Aamvata. Amavata can be correlated with Rheumatoid Arthritis due to similarities in clinical symtoms. Rheumatoid arthritis is one among the autoimmune diseases causing chronic symmetrical polyarthritis. The treatment in Modern science includes the use of NSAID’s (Non steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs), DMARD’s (Disease-Modifying Antirheumatic Drugs), glucocorticoids, and immune-suppressants, long-term use of which causes several side effects. Ayurveda treatment procedures and medication used for the treatment of Amavata have Agni Deepana, Ama Pachana, Vata Shamaka, Sroto shodhana actions which are helpful to retard disease process and reduce signs and symptoms of the disease. In the present case, 65-year female patient presented with, complaints of multiple joint pain with swelling and morning stiffness, restricted joint movements, loss of appetite, fatigue, weakness, fever (on and off), migratory pain, and symmetrical joint involvement. Patient was administered with Phalatrikadiguggulu, Shwadanshtradi guggulu. Mahayograjguggulu, Rasapachak vati, Sameerpannag rasa and Gandharvaharitaki churna added as Nitya Virechana. Ruksha Swedan with Valukapottali had also been given. The therapeutic interventions adopted in the study have shown beneficial effects in the patients of Aamvata.

2025-05-20 13:07:51,890 [DEBUG] Semantic Scholar article title: BREATHLEssness in INDIA (BREATHE-INDIA): realist review to develop explanatory programme theory about breathlessness self-management in India
2025-05-20 13:07:51,890 [DEBUG] Semantic Scholar article abstract: Breathlessness is highly prevalent in low and middle-income countries (LMICs). Low-cost, non-drug, breathlessness self-management interventions are effective in high-income countries. However, health beliefs influence acceptability and have not been explored in LMIC settings. Review with stakeholder engagement to co-develop explanatory programme theories for whom, if, and how breathlessness self-management might work in community settings in India. Iterative and systematic searches identified peer-reviewed articles, policy and media, and expert-identified sources. Data were extracted in terms of contribution to theory (high, medium, low), and theories developed with stakeholder groups (doctors, nurses and allied professionals, people with lived experiences, lay health workers) and an International Steering Group (RAMESES guidelines (PROSPERO42022375768)). One hundred and four data sources and 11 stakeholder workshops produced 8 initial programme theories and 3 consolidated programme theories. (1) Context: breathlessness is common due to illness, environment, and lifestyle. Cultural beliefs shape misunderstandings about breathlessness; hereditary, part of aging, linked to asthma. It is stigmatised and poorly understood as a treatable issue. People often use rest, incense, or tea, while avoiding physical activity due to fear of worsening breathlessness. Trusted voices, such as healthcare workers and community members, can help address misconceptions with clear, simple messages. (2) Breathlessness intervention applicability: nonpharmacological interventions can work across different contexts when they address unhelpful beliefs and behaviours. Introducing concepts like “too much rest leads to deconditioning” aligns with cultural norms while promoting beneficial behavioural changes, such as gradual physical activity. Acknowledging breathlessness as a medical issue is key to improving patient and family well-being. (3) Implementation: community-based healthcare workers are trusted but need simple, low-cost resources/skills integrated into existing training. Education should focus on managing acute episodes and daily breathlessness, reducing fear, and encouraging behavioural change. Evidence-based tools are vital to gain support from policymakers and expand implementation. Breathlessness management in India must integrate symptom management alongside public health and disease treatment strategies. Self-management interventions can be implemented in an LMIC setting. However, our novel methods indicate that understanding the context for implementation is essential so that unhelpful health beliefs can be addressed at the point of intervention delivery.

Introducing concepts like “too much rest leads to deconditioning” aligns with cultural norms while promoting beneficial behavioural changes, such as gradual physical activity. Acknowledging breathlessness as a medical issue is key to improving patient and family well-being. (3) Implementation: community-based healthcare workers are trusted but need simple, low-cost resources/skills integrated into existing training. Education should focus on managing acute episodes and daily breathlessness, reducing fear, and encouraging behavioural change. Evidence-based tools are vital to gain support from policymakers and expand implementation. Breathlessness management in India must integrate symptom management alongside public health and disease treatment strategies. Self-management interventions can be implemented in an LMIC setting.

Low-cost, non-drug, breathlessness self-management interventions are effective in high-income countries. However, health beliefs influence acceptability and have not been explored in LMIC settings. Review with stakeholder engagement to co-develop explanatory programme theories for whom, if, and how breathlessness self-management might work in community settings in India. Iterative and systematic searches identified peer-reviewed articles, policy and media, and expert-identified sources. Data were extracted in terms of contribution to theory (high, medium, low), and theories developed with stakeholder groups (doctors, nurses and allied professionals, people with lived experiences, lay health workers) and an International Steering Group (RAMESES guidelines (PROSPERO42022375768)). One hundred and four data sources and 11 stakeholder workshops produced 8 initial programme theories and 3 consolidated programme theories. (1) Context: breathlessness is common due to illness, environment, and lifestyle. Cultural beliefs shape misunderstandings about breathlessness; hereditary, part of aging, linked to asthma. It is stigmatised and poorly understood as a treatable issue. People often use rest, incense, or tea, while avoiding physical activity due to fear of worsening breathlessness.

Amavata can be correlated with Rheumatoid Arthritis due to similarities in clinical symtoms. Rheumatoid arthritis is one among the autoimmune diseases causing chronic symmetrical polyarthritis. The treatment in Modern science includes the use of NSAID’s (Non steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs), DMARD’s (Disease-Modifying Antirheumatic Drugs), glucocorticoids, and immune-suppressants, long-term use of which causes several side effects. Ayurveda treatment procedures and medication used for the treatment of Amavata have Agni Deepana, Ama Pachana, Vata Shamaka, Sroto shodhana actions which are helpful to retard disease process and reduce signs and symptoms of the disease. In the present case, 65-year female patient presented with, complaints of multiple joint pain with swelling and morning stiffness, restricted joint movements, loss of appetite, fatigue, weakness, fever (on and off), migratory pain, and symmetrical joint involvement.

2025-05-20 13:08:50,784 [DEBUG] PubMed article title: Diagnosis and management of treatment-refractory hypothyroidism: an expert consensus report.
2025-05-20 13:08:50,784 [DEBUG] PubMed article abstract: There is a frequently encountered subset of hypothyroid patients who are refractory to standard thyroid hormone replacement treatment and require unexpectedly high doses of levothyroxine. In addition to clinical situations where hypothyroid patients are non-compliant, or where there is the possibility of excipient-induced disease exacerbation (gluten/celiac disease), therapeutic failure may be due to impaired absorption of the administered drug. The common approach to managing patients with unusual thyroxine needs is to escalate the dose of levothyroxine until targeted TSH levels are achieved. This approach can increase the risk for prolonged exposure to supratherapeutic doses of levothyroxine, which increase the chances of adverse outcomes. Repeated adjustments of levothyroxine can also escalate the costs of treatment, as frequent office visits and laboratory tests are required to determine and maintain the desired dose. Clinicians should take a systematic approach to managing patients whom they suspect of having treatment-refractory hypothyroidism. This may include searching for, and adjusting, occult medical conditions and/or other factors that may affect the absorption of levothyroxine, before up-titrating the dose of traditional levothyroxine therapy. Depending on the underlying pathology, another approach that may be considered is to try alternative formulations of levothyroxine that are less susceptible to intolerance issues related to excipients, or, in some cases, to malabsorption. The early discovery of these factors via a thoughtful patient work-up may avoid unnecessary thyroid medication adjustments and their consequences for both patients and clinicians.

2025-05-20 13:08:55,473 [DEBUG] PubMed article abstract: Major depression is one of the most prevalent and debilitating personal and public health conditions worldwide. Less appreciated is that depression's tremendous burdens are not shared equally among all who become depressed. Some will suffer recurrences over the rest of their lives, whereas half or more will never have a recurrence. Based on these two distinctive life course prototypes, we propose a subtype distinction for research on the origins and lifetime course of major depression. A pressing goal is to determine at the time of depression's first onset who will follow which clinical trajectory. The lack of recognition of this distinction has resulted in many obstacles, including conceptual biases, methodological oversights, and definitional dead ends. Current theories are reviewed and compared. The implications for contemporary diagnostic controversies, reevaluating research on treatment and prevention, and enhancing the predictive strength of traditionally weak indicators of recurrences and recurrent depression are discussed.

2025-05-20 13:09:00,133 [DEBUG] PubMed article title: Calcium and/or Vitamin D Supplementation for the Prevention of Fragility Fractures: Who Needs It?
2025-05-20 13:09:00,133 [DEBUG] PubMed article abstract: Vitamin D and calcium have different biological functions, so the need for supplementation, and its safety and efficacy, need to be evaluated for each separately. Vitamin D deficiency is usually the result of low sunlight exposure (e.g., in frail older people, those who are veiled, those with dark-skin living at higher latitudes) and is reversible with calciferol 400-800 IU/day. Calcium supplements produce a 1% increase in bone density in the first year of use, without further increases subsequently. Vitamin D supplements do not improve bone density in clinical trials except in analyses of subgroups with baseline levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D <30 nmol/L. Supplementation with calcium, vitamin D, or their combination does not prevent fractures in community-dwelling adults, but a large study in vitamin D-deficient nursing home residents did demonstrate fracture prevention. When treating osteoporosis, co-administration of calcium with anti-resorptive drugs has not been shown to impact on treatment efficacy. Correction of severe vitamin D deficiency (<25 nmol/L) is necessary before use of potent anti-resorptive drugs to avoid hypocalcemia. Calcium supplements cause gastrointestinal side effects, particularly constipation, and increase the risk of kidney stones and, probably, heart attacks by about 20%. Low-dose vitamin D is safe, but doses >4000 IU/day have been associated with more falls and fractures. Current evidence does not support use of either calcium or vitamin D supplements in healthy community-dwelling adults.

In addition to clinical situations where hypothyroid patients are non-compliant, or where there is the possibility of excipient-induced disease exacerbation (gluten/celiac disease), therapeutic failure may be due to impaired absorption of the administered drug. The common approach to managing patients with unusual thyroxine needs is to escalate the dose of levothyroxine until targeted TSH levels are achieved. This approach can increase the risk for prolonged exposure to supratherapeutic doses of levothyroxine, which increase the chances of adverse outcomes. Repeated adjustments of levothyroxine can also escalate the costs of treatment, as frequent office visits and laboratory tests are required to determine and maintain the desired dose. Clinicians should take a systematic approach to managing patients whom they suspect of having treatment-refractory hypothyroidism. This may include searching for, and adjusting, occult medical conditions and/or other factors that may affect the absorption of levothyroxine, before up-titrating the dose of traditional levothyroxine therapy. Depending on the underlying pathology, another approach that may be considered is to try alternative formulations of levothyroxine that are less susceptible to intolerance issues related to excipients, or, in some cases, to malabsorption. The early discovery of these factors via a thoughtful patient work-up may avoid unnecessary thyroid medication adjustments and their consequences for both patients and clinicians.', 'pubmed_id': '28695483', 'url': 'https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28695483/', 'confidence': 'Recommended', 'relevance_score': '55.0%', 'relevance_tag': 'Relevant to hypothyroidism exacerbation', 'source': 'PubMed', 'authors': 'M Centanni, S Benvenga, I Sachmechi', 'year': '2017', 'raw_relevance_score': 55.00000000000001}, {'title': 'Team Up!', 'summary': 'N/A', 'pubmed_id': '28385316', 'url': 'https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28385316/', 'confidence': 'Highly Recommended', 'relevance_score': '100.0%', 'relevance_tag': 'Relevant to hypothyroidism exacerbation', 'source': 'PubMed', 'authors': 'Mary Norine Walsh', 'year': '2017', 'raw_relevance_score': 100}, {'title': "Canadian Network for Mood and Anxiety Treatments (CANMAT) 2023 Update on Clinical Guidelines for Management of Major Depressive Disorder in Adults: Réseau canadien pour les traitements de l'humeur et de l'anxiété (CANMAT) 2023 : Mise à jour des lignes directrices cliniques pour la prise en charge du trouble dépressif majeur chez les adultes.", 'summary': 'The Canadian Network for Mood and Anxiety Treatments (CANMAT) last published clinical guidelines for the management of major depressive disorder (MDD) in 2016.

Vitamin D deficiency is usually the result of low sunlight exposure (e.g., in frail older people, those who are veiled, those with dark-skin living at higher latitudes) and is reversible with calciferol 400-800 IU/day. Calcium supplements produce a 1% increase in bone density in the first year of use, without further increases subsequently. Vitamin D supplements do not improve bone density in clinical trials except in analyses of subgroups with baseline levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D <30 nmol/L. Supplementation with calcium, vitamin D, or their combination does not prevent fractures in community-dwelling adults, but a large study in vitamin D-deficient nursing home residents did demonstrate fracture prevention. When treating osteoporosis, co-administration of calcium with anti-resorptive drugs has not been shown to impact on treatment efficacy. Correction of severe vitamin D deficiency (<25 nmol/L) is necessary before use of potent anti-resorptive drugs to avoid hypocalcemia. Calcium supplements cause gastrointestinal side effects, particularly constipation, and increase the risk of kidney stones and, probably, heart attacks by about 20%.

2025-05-20 13:09:24,031 [DEBUG] Semantic Scholar article title: Management of Amavata w.s.r. to Rheumatoid Arthritis
2025-05-20 13:09:24,031 [DEBUG] Semantic Scholar article abstract: Vitiated Vata Dosha, weakened Agni, and accumulation of Ama at Shleshmic Sthana mainly at Sandhi (joints) are responsible for the development of Aamvata. Amavata can be correlated with Rheumatoid Arthritis due to similarities in clinical symtoms. Rheumatoid arthritis is one among the autoimmune diseases causing chronic symmetrical polyarthritis. The treatment in Modern science includes the use of NSAID’s (Non steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs), DMARD’s (Disease-Modifying Antirheumatic Drugs), glucocorticoids, and immune-suppressants, long-term use of which causes several side effects. Ayurveda treatment procedures and medication used for the treatment of Amavata have Agni Deepana, Ama Pachana, Vata Shamaka, Sroto shodhana actions which are helpful to retard disease process and reduce signs and symptoms of the disease. In the present case, 65-year female patient presented with, complaints of multiple joint pain with swelling and morning stiffness, restricted joint movements, loss of appetite, fatigue, weakness, fever (on and off), migratory pain, and symmetrical joint involvement. Patient was administered with Phalatrikadiguggulu, Shwadanshtradi guggulu. Mahayograjguggulu, Rasapachak vati, Sameerpannag rasa and Gandharvaharitaki churna added as Nitya Virechana. Ruksha Swedan with Valukapottali had also been given. The therapeutic interventions adopted in the study have shown beneficial effects in the patients of Aamvata.

Amavata can be correlated with Rheumatoid Arthritis due to similarities in clinical symtoms. Rheumatoid arthritis is one among the autoimmune diseases causing chronic symmetrical polyarthritis. The treatment in Modern science includes the use of NSAID’s (Non steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs), DMARD’s (Disease-Modifying Antirheumatic Drugs), glucocorticoids, and immune-suppressants, long-term use of which causes several side effects. Ayurveda treatment procedures and medication used for the treatment of Amavata have Agni Deepana, Ama Pachana, Vata Shamaka, Sroto shodhana actions which are helpful to retard disease process and reduce signs and symptoms of the disease. In the present case, 65-year female patient presented with, complaints of multiple joint pain with swelling and morning stiffness, restricted joint movements, loss of appetite, fatigue, weakness, fever (on and off), migratory pain, and symmetrical joint involvement.

Tell me, what\'s been going on?"\n"Morning, Dr. Ellis. It\'s… it\'s a lot. For the past six, maybe eight months, I\'ve been feeling this overwhelming fatigue. Not just tired, Doctor, but like my bones are made of lead. And I\'ve been getting these strange rashes, mostly on my arms and chest. They come and go, sometimes itchy, sometimes just red patches. My wife noticed I\'ve been more short of breath lately too, especially when I climb the stairs. And then there are the joint pains – my knees, my wrists, sometimes my fingers. They’re stiff in the morning, and they ache pretty much all day. I\'ve also had a couple of episodes where I felt like my heart was racing, just out of the blue, even when I was sitting down. Oh, and I\'ve lost a bit of weight without trying, maybe ten pounds."\n"Okay, Mr. Harrison, that is quite a constellation of symptoms. Let\'s break this down. The fatigue, you said it\'s debilitating?"\n"Yes, absolutely. I used to be quite active, but now even a short walk feels like a marathon."\n"And the rashes – can you describe them a bit more? Are they raised? Scaly?"\n"Sometimes they’re slightly raised, other times flat. Not really scaly, more like… blotchy. And they seem to worsen after I\'ve been out in the sun, even for a short while."\n"Sun sensitivity, noted. The shortness of breath – is it accompanied by any chest pain or wheezing?"\n"No distinct chest pain when I\'m breathless, more like a tightness. No wheezing that I\'ve noticed."\n"And the joint pain – is it symmetrical, meaning it affects both sides, say both knees or both wrists, fairly equally?"\n"Yes, I\'d say so. When my right knee flares up, the left one isn\'t far behind. Same with my hands."\n"Have you noticed any swelling in the joints?"\n"Yes, sometimes my fingers and knuckles look a bit puffy, especially in the morning."\n"Alright. And the heart palpitations – how long do those episodes last? Any dizziness or fainting associated with them?"\n"They can last a few minutes, maybe up to ten. I do feel a bit lightheaded during them, but I haven\'t fainted."\n"Any other symptoms? Fevers? Swollen glands? Mouth sores? Hair loss?"\n"Now that you mention it, I have had a couple of mouth ulcers that were quite painful. And my hair seems thinner than it used to be, but I just put that down to getting older."\n"Okay, Mr. Harrison. Based on what you\'re describing – the multisystem involvement including the skin, joints, fatigue, shortness of breath, and photosensitivity, along with the mouth ulcers and possible hair thinning – we need to consider a few possibilities. One of the conditions that comes to mind, given this pattern, is an autoimmune process, something like systemic lupus erythematosus, or SLE. This is a condition where the body\'s immune system mistakenly attacks its own healthy tissues and organs. It can affect many different parts of the body, which would explain the wide range of symptoms you\'re experiencing."\n"Lupus? I\'ve heard of it. That sounds serious."\n"It can be, but it\'s also a manageable condition for many people. The key is getting an accurate diagnosis and starting appropriate treatment. The symptoms you\'re describing, such as the malar rash or butterfly rash which can be sun-sensitive, the arthritis, pleuritis or pericarditis which could explain the shortness of breath and palpitations, and the hematologic and neurologic aspects we haven’t fully explored yet, are all potential criteria. To investigate this further, I\'d like to order a series of blood tests. We\'ll need to look for specific autoantibodies, like an ANA, or antinuclear antibody, anti-dsDNA, and anti-Smith antibodies, which are often present in SLE. We\'ll also check your inflammatory markers, kidney and liver function, and a complete blood count. Depending on those results, we might also consider imaging, perhaps a chest X-ray or an echocardiogram to assess your heart and lungs more closely. It’s important we rule out other conditions as well, such as rheumatoid arthritis, Sjogren’s syndrome, or even certain infections that can mimic these symptoms, though the constellation you present is quite suggestive. For now, I want you to keep a detailed symptom diary – note any new rashes, joint pain flare-ups, episodes of breathlessness or palpitations, and any potential triggers you notice, especially sun exposure. This will be very helpful as we move forward."\n"Okay, Doctor. That\'s a lot to take in. So, blood tests first."\n"Yes. We\'ll get those drawn today if you have the time. We need to gather more information to piece this puzzle together. It\'s a complex picture, Mr. Harrison, but we\'ll work through it systematically."\n"I appreciate that, Dr. Ellis. Thank you."\n"You\'re welcome. We\'ll schedule a follow-up to discuss the results as soon as they\'re available. My nurse will give you the lab forms and help you with scheduling."\n\n    Ensure all medical terms are accurate and contextualized for a professional allergist. Include specific details (e.g., medication names with exact dosages, test types). Avoid speculative diagnoses; flag uncertainty for human review. For the enhanced_recommendations section, be exceptionally thorough and specific, providing detailed actionable insights based on current clinical guidelines and evidence-based best practices. Include precise timelines and measurable outcomes where appropriate.\n\n    Output in JSON format:\n    {\n        "patient_history": {\n            "chief_complaint": "string",\n            "history_of_present_illness": "string",\n            "past_medical_history": "string",\n            "allergies": "string",\n            "social_history": "string",\n            "review_of_systems": "string"\n        },\n        "physical_examination": "string",\n        "differential_diagnosis": "string",\n        "diagnostic_workup": "string",\n        "plan_of_care": "string",\n        "patient_education": "string",\n        "follow_up_instructions": "string",\n        "summary": "string",\n        "enhanced_recommendations": "string"\n    }\n    '}], 'max_tokens': 2500, 'temperature': 0.25}

2025-05-20 13:10:04,488 [DEBUG] PubMed article abstract: Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic inflammatory disease characterized by progressive damage of synovial-lined joints and variable extra-articular manifestations. Tendon and bursal involvement are frequent and often clinically dominant in early disease. RA can affect any joint, but it is usually found in metacarpophalangeal, proximal interphalangeal and metatarsophalangeal joints, as well as in the wrists and knee. Articular and periarticular manifestations include joint swelling and tenderness to palpation, with morning stiffness and severe motion impairment in the involved joints. The clinical presentation of RA varies, but an insidious onset of pain with symmetric swelling of small joints is the most frequent finding. RA onset is acute or subacute in about 25% of patients, but its patterns of presentation also include palindromic onset, monoarticular presentation (both slow and acute forms), extra-articular synovitis (tenosynovitis, bursitis), polymyalgic-like onset, and general symptoms (malaise, fatigue, weight loss, fever). The palindromic onset is characterized by recurrent episodes of oligoarthritis with no residual radiologic damage, while the polymyalgic-like onset may be clinically indistinguishable from polymyalgia rheumatica in elderly subjects. RA is characteristically a symmetric erosive disease. Although any joint, including the cricoarytenoid joint, can be affected, the distal interphalangeal, the sacroiliac, and the lumbar spine joints are rarely involved. The clinical features of synovitis are particularly apparent in the morning. Morning stiffness in and around the joints, lasting at least 1 h before maximal improvement is a typical sign of RA. It is a subjective sign and the patient needs to be carefully informed as to the difference between pain and stiffness. Morning stiffness duration is related to disease activity. Hand involvement is the typical early manifestation of rheumatoid arthritis. Synovitis involving the metacarpophalangeal, proximal interphalangeal and wrist joints causes a characteristic tender swelling on palpation with early severe motion impairment and no radiologic evidence of bone damage. Fatigue, feveret, weight loss, and malaise are frequent clinical signs which can be associated with variable manifestations of extra-articular involvement such as rheumatoid nodules, vasculitis, hematologic abnormalities, Felty's syndrome, and visceral involvement. Although there is no laboratory test to exclude or prove the diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis, several laboratory abnormalities can be detected. Abnormal values of the tests for evaluation of systemic inflammation are the most typical humoral features of RA. These include: erythrocyte sedimentation rate, acute phase proteins and plasma viscosity. Erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein provide the best information about the acute phase response. The C-reactive protein is strictly correlated with clinical assessment and radiographic changes. Plain film radiography is the standard investigation to assess the extent of anatomic changes in rheumatoid arthritis patients. The radiographic features of the hand joints in early disease are characterized by soft tissue swelling and mild juxtaarticular osteoporosis. In the the past 10 years, ultrasonography has gained acceptance for studying joint, tendon and bursal involvement in RA. It may improve the early clinical assessment and the follow-up of these patients, showing such details as synovial thickening even within finger joints. Other imaging techniques, such as magnetic resonance, computed tomography and scintigraphy may provide useful information about both the features and the extent for anatomic damage in selected rheumatoid arthritis patients. The natural history of the disease is poorly defined; its clinical course is fluctuating and the prognosis unpredictable. RA is an epidemiologically relevant cause of disability. An adequate early treatment of RA may alter the diseas

2025-05-20 13:10:04,489 [DEBUG] PubMed article abstract: Key principles of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) management include early patient evaluation by a rheumatologist and early initiation of pharmacologic therapy in patients at risk for chronic disease. Early diagnosis and appropriate management are essential to prevent joint damage. Patients with RA usually report pain and swelling in multiple joints and prolonged stiffness in the morning that improves with activity. Joint involvement typically is bilateral and symmetric. RA affects large and small joints, particularly the metacarpophalangeal and proximal interphalangeal joints of the hands. Patients with RA may be started on nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, glucocorticoids, or conventional synthetic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) before evaluation by a rheumatologist. Patients who have a poor response to conventional synthetic DMARDs or aggressive arthritis at initial evaluation may be prescribed biologic or targeted synthetic DMARDs. Anti-tumor necrosis factor alpha agents also may be used. Patients typically are managed with a treat-to-target strategy to achieve and maintain low disease activity or remission. Regular monitoring visits using formal assessment of disease activity have been shown to improve outcomes. RA and the medications used in its treatment are associated with increased risks of infections and malignancy. Integrative medicine therapies with limited evidence include acupuncture, mind-body therapies (eg, yoga, tai chi), and dietary supplements.

2025-05-20 13:10:04,490 [DEBUG] PubMed insights for 'Rheumatoid Arthritis due to symmetrical joint involvement and morning stiffness': [{'title': 'The clinical features of rheumatoid arthritis.', 'summary': "Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic inflammatory disease characterized by progressive damage of synovial-lined joints and variable extra-articular manifestations. Tendon and bursal involvement are frequent and often clinically dominant in early disease. RA can affect any joint, but it is usually found in metacarpophalangeal, proximal interphalangeal and metatarsophalangeal joints, as well as in the wrists and knee. Articular and periarticular manifestations include joint swelling and tenderness to palpation, with morning stiffness and severe motion impairment in the involved joints. The clinical presentation of RA varies, but an insidious onset of pain with symmetric swelling of small joints is the most frequent finding. RA onset is acute or subacute in about 25% of patients, but its patterns of presentation also include palindromic onset, monoarticular presentation (both slow and acute forms), extra-articular synovitis (tenosynovitis, bursitis), polymyalgic-like onset, and general symptoms (malaise, fatigue, weight loss, fever). The palindromic onset is characterized by recurrent episodes of oligoarthritis with no residual radiologic damage, while the polymyalgic-like onset may be clinically indistinguishable from polymyalgia rheumatica in elderly subjects. RA is characteristically a symmetric erosive disease. Although any joint, including the cricoarytenoid joint, can be affected, the distal interphalangeal, the sacroiliac, and the lumbar spine joints are rarely involved. The clinical features of synovitis are particularly apparent in the morning. Morning stiffness in and around the joints, lasting at least 1 h before maximal improvement is a typical sign of RA. It is a subjective sign and the patient needs to be carefully informed as to the difference between pain and stiffness. Morning stiffness duration is related to disease activity. Hand involvement is the typical early manifestation of rheumatoid arthritis. Synovitis involving the metacarpophalangeal, proximal interphalangeal and wrist joints causes a characteristic tender swelling on palpation with early severe motion impairment and no radiologic evidence of bone damage. Fatigue, feveret, weight loss, and malaise are frequent clinical signs which can be associated with variable manifestations of extra-articular involvement such as rheumatoid nodules, vasculitis, hematologic abnormalities, Felty's syndrome, and visceral involvement. Although there is no laboratory test to exclude or prove the diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis, several laboratory abnormalities can be detected. Abnormal values of the tests for evaluation of systemic inflammation are the most typical humoral features of RA. These include: erythrocyte sedimentation rate, acute phase proteins and plasma viscosity. Erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein provide the best information about the acute phase response. The C-reactive protein is strictly correlated with clinical assessment and radiographic changes. Plain film radiography is the standard investigation to assess the extent of anatomic changes in rheumatoid arthritis patients. The radiographic features of the hand joints in early disease are characterized by soft tissue swelling and mild juxtaarticular osteoporosis. In the the past 10 years, ultrasonography has gained acceptance for studying joint, tendon and bursal involvement in RA. It may improve the early clinical assessment and the follow-up of these patients, showing such details as synovial thickening even within finger joints. Other imaging techniques, such as magnetic resonance, computed tomography and scintigraphy may provide useful information about both the features and the extent for anatomic damage in selected rheumatoid arthritis patients. The natural history of the disease is poorly defined; its clinical course is fluctuating and the prognosis unpredictable. RA is an epidemiologically relevant cause of disability.

Is that OK if I do it today? Yeah. And then we can, umm, see how bad your. Lungs are OK and when did you last take your Claritin? Like a long time, like OK, but over a week ago. So how long are you here for from college? I\'m here till August, so I will bring you back for the allergy test. OK. OK, so you\'re interested in shots or drops. I don\'t know how you would do at college uh. What do you mean? So let me explain Publics. Which Publix do you work at? Do one there. The prescription for albuterol. Yeah, the one over in, uh, Beachwood Plaza, like right off of Manatee 75th. In Bradenton, is it called or? Yeah, It\'s like down closer, like towards the island. Like you\'re heading out to the island. Yeah, yeah, yeah. 7310 Manatee Ave. right. It should be. It\'s one on Manatee and 75th. So yeah, 73 probably that one. So I\'m sending the albuterol there. OK. Oh yeah. Tell me any food allerg? Drug allergy, bee sting allergy, uh, food allergies, just gluten. What celiac or yeah, celiac disease or like I haven\'t been they didn\'t put me under the officially test me \'cause I got kind of like diagnosed when I was 4, but and my mom didn\'t want to put me under. But when I started you didn\'t do endoscopy? Nothing. No. But when I went on a gluten free diet like. All like the eczema and stuff like that I had when I was 4, like cleared up right away and so they just kept me on gluten free diet and it\'s so you don\'t eat anything. I don\'t really eat any gluten at all. Just stay gluten free. When have you tried anything or no? No, not really. OK. I mean, good and see what happens. I\'m not sure if you have celiac disease. Yeah, it\'s been a while. Yeah, if you want to. It\'s been a while. And then like I always ask it to be tested for the like. That\'s like cost money is like, I get that. But it was just when I was four, they didn\'t want to put me like, under. Why don\'t you try some gluten and see what happens? Yeah. I mean, I can work with my parents so, you know, if they\'re OK with that. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, just you want to figure it out if it\'s if it, if the symptoms develop, then you stop it. Yeah. Yeah. And I think my mom\'s coming in later, too, so I can always talk with her about. So, but no other drug allergies based on allergies, no infection, sinus infections, bronchitis, pneumonia. Uh, I don\'t think so. I think you don\'t have any suggestions, mainly just some allergies, No eczema, hives, rashes. No, not nothing like that. OK, sounds good. So I your insurance won\'t allow testing, I\'ll have to bring you back. Do breathing test today, OK? Oh, yeah, All right. And then I send the albuterol there.

No, Doctor Sabo. Well, nice to meet you. How are you? How are you? I\'m good. We\'ll send you over to me. Well. Orchid Dermatology Dr. Yep. Yeah. Did she? She was. She sent me some stuff. Yes. OK. Uh-huh. So tell me what\'s going on. Well, at about three, 3 1/2 months ago, I was in Mississippi helping take care of my youngest daughter. She\'s got five kids and she needed, she\'s not doing, she\'s not doing well. Anyway, I started, I mean, she\'s really serious. But anyway, I started getting these. Bumps, extremely itchy bumps right there. When you were there with her? Was there all over the body? Well, no, my arms in between my fingers. When was it? When did it start? About three. I was there 3 1/2 months. OK, so I\'m going to. Three months ago OK so then so then the thing about the bumps is it would start out as a bump umm hum like you can kind of see this one umm hum and it would get bigger and it would be so intensely itchy, you know umm hum and then a white skin thing would grow. I see that on the other. And the biopsy, but you can see them. Sure, yeah, would start. And when the skin would peel off, it would stop itching. But then you can see how it just expanded in it, it it grew from this little bump to this. Odd shaped thing. So I went to a walk in clinic and he told me he thought it was some kind of a contact. Allergic reaction. Dermatitis huh? He gave me some medicine for it. Did not work so when I got home. I got into my, my yearly appointment with sure with doctor Guru and she\'s and it continued, Huh. Oh yeah, and steroids. Did they give you oral steroids? Steroids took it away. Oh, oral she yeah, she uh, on topical Prednisone, not topical. No, she told me. This will, I\'m pretty sure this is going to take care of it, but you need to see an allergist because if this comes back, it\'s going to come back on a vengeance. I went. Thanks. So she did the So she gave the Prednisone to you, not The Walking? No. OK. And she ordered, she got the biopsy. It showed some acute spongiotic dermatitis. Yeah. Yeah. It came back as inconclusive, more or less. And that\'s when she said you need to see an allergist to find out maybe what\'s going on. Yeah. What\'s going on? What are you allergic to? OK. Umm, I\'m trying to think of what? I use every day in my life. That started from there. I mean, I took myself on Doctor Garb\'s approval because the doctor in Memphis thought maybe it was the allopurinol I was allergic to. Umm, hum. So when I saw Doctor Grove a couple weeks ago, I go every six months to my GP. He said go ahead and go off of it. It\'s fine, you know, because I have gout and we\'ll, we\'ll deal with that later. Dennis telling me it could take up to six weeks for the for you to not show signs of being allergic to it. So I\'ve been off of the all puranol probably. Three weeks. Hum. So at this point I don\'t have any new ones. Hmm. But you can still see remnants of the old ones up my legs. But were they popping up more before? Oh my gosh, I was covered. And when did you stop the steroids? About two or three days ago. Very recently, but they\'re underneath my feet, back of my knees, my legs, so maybe the IT was allopurinol. We\'ll see time. No, your time will tell if you don\'t get anymore. Yeah, I don\'t at this point it\'s just like what do I do? So now they\'re not no new popping up, so that\'s good, but the steroids probably. Some too. So this itching just started then, huh? But you\'ve been on allopurinol for a long time? I\'ve been at allopurinol for probably maybe a year. And I don\'t have gout because of what I eat. I have gout because the one blood pressure medication I take is a is a Mexite is a water pill and it causes. Gout so thus my gout is caused from the medication I\'m on so they can\'t stop that. The tramter I did hydrochlorothiazide. We tried that and I gained 21 lbs in a week from swelling. My body, my legs swole so bad, Doctor Grubb said. No, no, no, no, no. You\'re going back on it. And I still have a little bit of, of swelling. You know, I live with it. I do see a cardiologist once a year and I saw him last week and he asked me about it, you know, so he\'s aware of it. But he he did take me off the allopurinol. So yeah, see, I\'m pinching that one. So And how long have you taken the triamtin on hydrocortisone? I was diagnosed with high blood pressure when I was probably 2627. OK. And that many years. Umm hum. I\'ll be 70 this year. So that\'s, what, 4550 years? Yeah. And no, the metoprolol and omeprazole\'s new or old, too. The omeprazole is because I had been diagnosed with Barrett\'s esophagus. So, Doctor Roddenberry, my gastro, Who? I see you next week. Put me on that. So there was no chance of me having when is that? When was that the on my personal? Oh, I\'ve been on that probably 10-8 or ten years. Yeah. So they didn\'t think it was KBS or anything, right? No, no, he he didn\'t he didn\'t think it was. He said that, but it didn\'t umm, manifest itself that way, and I don\'t think Doctor Grubb didn\'t. I mean Kate Gruber didn\'t see see that either because I still have them. When I saw Doctor, my dermatologist, they were still there. She said the this stuff is going to cure them for you. You\'re going, it\'s going to help take rid of them, but I can\'t guarantee you it won\'t come back. They won\'t come back. OK. Any seasonal allergies? Runny nose? Yeah. Yeah. You have that postnasal drip stuff? Yeah. What do you take for that? I I usually don\'t take anything, to be honest with you. Any asthma? No, no. Other infection history, sinusitis, pneumonia. No no, no food or drug allergy. I turn over onions what happens? Oh I get come out ******* sick. What? Commode hugging sick. OK First day I had with my husband of 40 years. I didn\'t want to tell him. 1/2 an hour later after dinner I was puking my guts off. Oh so if I eat a lot of them I will be? I mean, my stomach cramps up and I get yeah, OK, yeah. So no life threatening allergy, right? No, and no food drug allergy, right? Not that I can think of. No. Sounds good. So, uh, do you take any supplements or you started taking? I do, I take. I\'ve been taking calcium D3 for years. And vitamins, multi vitamins. I also take folic acid and then I take something for like like a milk Thistle. I would stop. The supplements can cause this too. OK, Just even the vitamins and stuff for a while, for a while, a month, OK. And we restart one at a time. OK, everyone every week or two weeks. OK, so you know which one, if it was causing, just stop it for a month, OK? OK. I mean, if the rash comes back, if the rash does not come back, then you don\'t have to. Well, I have to tell you before I left for Mississippi. My husband and I had this bright idea to go to see the table in Naples. And if you\'ve never done that, you need to do it before Myers. It\'s amazing. It\'s all food. It it, it is, but it\'s also holistic items. It\'s you have to see it, look it up. If you look at them online, it is truly amazing. It\'s worth a trip. What did it do? He took a supplement to for parasites. Which took 17 days of this supplement to get rid of parasites in your system because I know everybody probably has parasites. I, I know that so we did take that and I, I finished taking that in Mississippi but it\'s been. I only took it for 17 days, something like that. So I don\'t know if they caused a reaction when I don\'t know because I I that\'s been probably 2 1/2 months since I\'ve been off of that. Yeah, that\'s right. So just stop the supplements, OK. If the rash comes back, maybe. Allopurinol is a common drug which can cause itching. Also, hydrochlorothiazide can cause itching. I\'ve seen them, but I\'ve been on it for so many years. But yeah, you can develop anytime. But so one thought, you know, I\'m not going to change anything right now for you because the rash is gone. Yep, we are at a good spot. If it starts coming back, then we do something. We\'re off allopurinol. OK, so let\'s wait it out and OK, see what happens, OK. And if it doesn\'t come back for a month or two, you might even want to restart your allopurinol. You don\'t want gout with this medicine. Well, I\'m uh, I think my gout number was 7.4 the last time. So they\'ll just monitor for now. OK, so you don\'t need to be on a medicine. No, he told me you can absolutely go off of it, you know, because I was concerned about this. Yeah, but will he restart it at some point? He probably will. It\'s. But let\'s calculate this, right. OK. Umm, I mean, 7.5 is normal, so it\'s not that bad. When I was first diagnosed, it was 10. OK, so it\'s come down a lot. On medicine, so no, you\'re not on. So you don\'t want that. So let\'s deal with that in like a month or two, OK? OK. Like because once we see they will evolution OK, of the rash, OK? So there was also a biopsy, they said maybe contact dermatitis like some chemicals touching your body or your jewelry sometimes anything, shampoo, your hair dye, anything you can get. Allergic to So I offer a patch test for that. We test for 79 common North American allergens, which can be in your cosmetics, your metals, your clothes, anything. But that has to be You have to wait one month after being on steroids to do that. You can\'t do it right now. Oh, OK, You just finished a job schedule you in a month on a Monday at my other office. If you can do that appointment and we\'ll do that patch test for chemical, OK. If you want to know if there was any chemical allergy going on, contact allergy contact, OK, Dermatitis, OK. I mean if we make that appointment and then say in a month I have. No more outbreaks. And then I mean, do you still think it\'s a good thing to do just to know? If yeah, I guess because who knows what was, you know, affecting you, then at least maybe we\'ll have some answer and maybe you can go back to your allopurinol more easily. You know what I mean? Yeah. It\'s it\'s OK to do it because there\'s question on the biopsy. It\'s a three day process. You come on. To my other office I put patches, you sleep with them, you go Wednesday, we remove it, you come back. And then Thursday you come here and I waited again. So those OK, three days, no gym, no shower, no swimming, no wetting your back. So just be careful with that. So Monday I get the patch, Yes, Wednesday, Tuesday and yeah, Wednesday and Wednesday I come back. Another office remove it and then Thursday again yeah. So 32 readings OK OK, so we\'ll do that in a month from OK seasonal allergy testing we can do today if you want to see if there\'s any pollen, cat, dog, dust mites, mold allergy going on. I mean, I\'ve got a cat. I don\'t I\'ve never had any and I know. Sometimes just mind allergy can cause eczema and rashes and stuff like that. If there was any dust mites in the house there or something, old mattresses, carpets, stuff like that. I don\'t have carpet. Maybe your daughter had it there or well, she\'s got, she\'s got all. No, her bedroom has carpet, so I don\'t know. So if you want, we can do that today. Is it covered by insurance? Oh, I don\'t know. I think testing\'s $15 office visit is 20. Yeah, it\'s not the 50. Yeah, more. Yeah, you\'re probably good to know, right, right. Yeah, yeah. Just to see if there\'s any factors there that caused it. So you next time you\'re not like worried about it. You know what you know, OK, so let\'s do the environmental allergy that will also help your spring pollen. You\'ll know OK, if you have I\'m allergic to Yeah, OK, so let\'s do that. You\'ve not taken any allergy medicine or Benadryl, nothing, right? No. So let\'s do that today and then one month we\'ll bring you for that. OK, so that\'ll clear some answers. And also you\'ll be off atopurinol. And right, we\'ll see what will happen if the rashes start coming back. You stop all your supplements right away. OK? I will, I will. OK, today was the last day. No supplement. Just keep it. Let\'s if the rash comes back. So I need but you want me to go off him for a month if the rash starts. Oh, OK, quickly then. Oh, so I can still take him. Yeah, because I\'m not sure. Maybe allopurinol. Why do why? To stop something. OK, because I\'m not. If any new rashes develop, you will stop all of them. All my. My. Supplements, OK. Calcium and everything, Yeah, OK. Plus, I don\'t want to give more steroids, you know? Deep breath. Keep up. And no rash right now, right? No, it\'s just the these reminiscent remnants. I mean, you know, there, it\'s not. You don\'t have any pictures. When it was worse, you know, I did take a picture that I sent. It\'s OK, you can find it later. Let me send my nurse. We\'ll do the allergy. No asthma, right? Nothing else? No. OK sounds.\n\n    Ensure all medical terms are accurate and contextualized for a professional allergist.

    "chief_complaint": "Itchy, expanding skin lesions for 3.5 months, initially appearing during a stay in Mississippi, with moderate to severe intensity.",
    "history_of_present_illness": "The patient, a 69-year-old female, developed intensely itchy bumps on her arms and between her fingers approximately 3.5 months ago while assisting her daughter in Mississippi. The lesions started as small bumps, which expanded and developed into larger, oddly shaped patches with a white skin overlay that peeled off, alleviating the itch temporarily. She visited a walk-in clinic where contact dermatitis was suspected, and she was prescribed an unspecified medication that did not resolve the issue. Upon returning home, she consulted her primary care physician, Dr. Guru, who prescribed oral Prednisone, which effectively cleared the rash. However, Dr. Guru recommended seeing an allergist due to the possibility of recurrence. The patient has been off allopurinol for three weeks, which was initially suspected to be the cause of the rash. No new lesions have appeared since stopping allopurinol and Prednisone, but remnants of old lesions are still visible. The patient reports no new itching since discontinuing the steroids.",

I\'ll let you know. This is the next accumulation. Hello. Hey, Doctor Sabo. Well, nice to meet you. Who sent you over to me? Huh. Who sent you over to me? No, I looked you up. OK. And I I think my kids have seen you before. OK, so. Or at least allergy affiliates. Yeah. OK. Yeah. Until Lalani is your primary care doctor. Yes. OK. So tell me what\'s going on with you. Have asthma and celiac disease. Yes, I have celiac and. Over the last six months, I\'ve just been going through some GI work and, uh, recently diagnosed or huh, recently diagnosed? Celiac or no, that was diagnosed in 2011. OK, umm. Umm, so I had some blood work done I and we identified some more allergies. So it came back with cow\'s milk or dairy and shrimp. And so I wanted to. Inquire about getting tested to find out like what out Like what else can I be possibly allergic to that I\'m not aware of? So what were you seeing the GI for? I was having a lot of umm. Bloating and nausea and they did endoscopy yes. What did they find? Celiac was controlled Nothing no no side no like iron damage or anything no. So who would recommended testing? So for the foods GI did my primary Lulani, he did the we\'re trying to figure out what what could be causing it. And so he wanted to run. The panel, the allergy and look at the celiac. Do you have the blood work right results? I don\'t think I have the where did you do it? I don\'t have the allergy ones. Umm, where did you do? I don\'t have it. I don\'t have a referral from him, so I don\'t have the results. Did you do it at Quest? Yeah, I\'ll have my nurse look at it. OK. If that\'s OK, results for. All right, so she\'ll look at those. OK. Mm-hmm. Umm so it just got me thinking about allergies and what else might I be allergic to? Umm hum. So it was the dairy and shrimp and gluten, it came back positive. Or yeah, gluten, just celiac. It didn\'t come back. Umm. It was. I\'d have to look. At the description So what are you avoiding .10 and then the dairy measured .11 and then shrimp was like .37, the small positive barely. So did you avoid dairy? I did umm, but it didn\'t change anything. It didn\'t, it didn\'t \'cause I don\'t know what else is going on and so I don\'t, I shrimp also. You avoid. Yes, I have not had shrimp at all, but anything happened when you eat. Dairy and shrimp, No, nothing would happen immediately. Yeah. And the, the belly pain, the nausea, the the bloating would not happen with the eating any particular food, right. Not that I know of. So So what did the GI thing IBS or something going on or what? No I have a follow up endoscopy. I had a colonoscopy and everything was fine there. So the doctor is going down the path of looking at other inflammation. Related stuff. So I\'m doing more blood work tomorrow. OK, so GI hasn\'t finished yet, right? Umm, the GI is done. It\'s my primary. OK, who? So GI? What did GI say? What does? What\'s causing all this bloating? And they didn\'t. They don\'t know correct? So they put you on a pantoprazole. That\'s the stomach one my doctor did twice a day. Milani did but I only take it in the morning and then my I use. It\'s a heartburn, one that I take at night. And that\'s what, and that\'s what the GI doctor gave Pepcid, is that it\'s a over. It\'s an prescription, one Famotidine. OK, maybe I don\'t know the names. So I take that one at night, OK, for the heart, for reflux basically. And the asthma was diagnosed long time ago, long time ago. And you albuterol, you don\'t take a lot, do you? No, it\'s mostly related to like sports, OK. Umm, so I exercise, I run outside and when I run. You take it before Yeah and, uh, Flonase nose spray. You have seasonal allergies, Yes. So I just spring, fall or year round. Get round so you take. I moved. Year. Every day. Or no, not every day. Like I\'ve been taking it over the last last week, but I\'ve had this cold so we\'ve been trying to dry the cold out. But before that I hadn\'t used it for a month for a few months. OK, so just Flonase one spray each nostril daily, yes. No. Zyrtec, Claritin, Benadryl. Do you take anything? No. Like that? No. Do have you ever been tested for allergies and asthma? No. You want to be? Yes. So for the seasonal allergies and asthma, too, to see where your lungs are baseline. Yeah. OK. Yeah. So I can do that or not today. We\'ll have to bring you back for that. OK. Your insurance won\'t allow that today, so. Bring you back. But breathing test, maybe it\'ll allow if you want me to do that, I can do that today. OK OK, so we\'ll do the breathing full breathing test, bring you back, give you a breathing treatment and repeat the breathing test to see how your lungs are got you. And then you no allergy medicine. And then I\'ll bring you back for for the Yeah, I haven\'t had any allergy medicine. Fine. Their Flonase is OK, that\'s not doesn\'t affect my testing. So I\'ll bring you back this Thursday if you have a time, OK, to come back for that. OK, yes, as far as reflux goes, you\'re fine. You\'re uh, I think you should talk to your GI and your primary Yeah, if you need that long term or no. But as far as food is concerned. The kind of testing I do for food allergies is mainly for life threatening food allergies. OK, uh, which is like, uh, when you get the highest difficulty breathing, wheezing, you need a nappy pen, right? So you would know if a food was causing you abdominal pain or vomiting or diarrhea. And immediately after eating you would have known by now, OK, the intolerances can happen, which you know are very it\'s it they\'re diagnosed by trial and error method like you have to avoid a food for good two to three weeks to see if you feel better then you just keep avoiding. If not, you put it back in. Because we don\'t want you to avoid a lot of foods. You already avoiding gluten, you know I don\'t want to you do a white milk and shrimp, OK? Even if it was positive, it can be false positive on the blood, OK? I don\'t generally even recommend doing those because of the situation When they become false positive, then we just avoiding food for no reason, OK. So you can reintroduce and see what happens. I mean milk is one thing which can cause intolerance along with gluten in a lot of people, lactose intolerance and stuff. So milk is something if you have avoided for how long? Couple months, but he that was in March that I\'d started and I voided it for a good three weeks. Maybe a month and I didn\'t feel any different and he\'s had to start introducing and nothing changed again. Not really. So then I wouldn\'t. But did you avoid complete milk, including butter, sour cream? Yes. Reading labels like your yes. I bought like vegan everything, plant based butter. OK, so you did everything. Yes. So yeah. Four weeks is what I recommend. Three to four weeks, OK. And if not, you introduce it back. That\'s the right way to do it. So now milk, you\'re introducing Eden drinking and then shrimp also. You should just try if you never had a reaction to shrimp before. OK. OK. Not that I was aware of. Yeah. Yeah. So I mean, it can develop, you have. Anytime shellfish is 1 allergy that can develop as a life threatening allergy in an adult too OK where you can have highest difficulty breathing throat closing only shellfish OK none of the other foods really you can develop yes I had gone out for well I went out to dinner with my sister-in-law and I had sushi and it was. Real crab and then I did not feel good the next day, but I don\'t know I like when I ate it I didn\'t feel anything but the next day I did not feel OK. So I didn\'t know that was part of like all right, let me see what I can get allergy tested because I just don\'t know what. Allergies, like life threatening allergies happen within two hours of eating any right food too, right. So if you want, I can test you for shrimp, crab, lobster. Like I said, I can have false positive and then I\'ll just tell you to avoid and give you an EpiPen and all that chest will happen. Why? No, I just want to find out what my body age. So like I\'m saying the GI stuff. Yeah, the GI. Might not be food related, right? Might be something else going on or not inflammatory. That\'s what I\'m trying to get at, sure. So gluten, yes, but gluten can be, you know, sometimes people with Celia get more sensitive. It can mean your shampoos, your anything. Cross contamination. So you need to look everything. Maybe you\'re getting some in some form. I don\'t know what the GI people say that, but I see all these people talking about gluten free shampoos, gluten free soaps. OK, you have to go like more. Detailed of what\'s touching your body, what\'s in your food, maybe it\'s not getting cross contaminated from other stuff. So maybe be mindful of that rather than going ahead and finding if it\'s more foods causing it. I don\'t think so, OK, Unless like I said, dairy, you know, intolerance. You tried you. Can if you want to try, you can do soy and eggs avoidance like a month and see OK, but that\'ll be just by doing trial and error. OK, There\'s not a very good test. If you told me you have life threatening I can do 50 foods on you, I got you, but I don\'t I can do it but I don\'t want to because it can be false. OK, And it doesn\'t yield me the information I need to tell you, hey, magically stop this, your symptoms will go away, OK? It won\'t. OK OK, You know what I mean. OK, so but for the shrimp, crab, lobster is one thing which you can develop as an adult if you want, I can test you. But if it\'s false positive, then you have to avoid it and I have to give you an EpiPen. I. Rather test that one. I shall fish. I\'ll test you. That\'s the only that was that one was the surprise. And then they know how I felt after the crack. OK, again, not life threatening. Yeah, I didn\'t stop. And it was like say it\'s unlikely, but but let me test you for shellfish, OK. And environmental when you come back Thursday. OK OK. And then today we\'ll do the breathing. But other foods, soy and eggs and nuts, you can do one at a time, OK, for a month each time, OK, So go for soy, eggs, nuts. You already did gluten and dairy, so OK. And then seafood, we say after that, OK. OK, So just common foods eaten commonly cause more common reactions, right, Than not uncommon foods. OK, OK. OK, so do that. OK, yes, and then I would. Do a breathing test today to see what\'s going on. OK, no eczema, highs, rashes. No. No history of recurrent sinusitis, bronchitis, pneumonia. I\'ve had pneumonia. Bronchitis, haven\'t had for a while, just one Pneumonia. Not more than that. Right. Pneumonia. Yeah, just once. OK. That was a year and a half ago. That\'s fine. So then I think we\'re good on that. OK. Sounds good. Yeah. All right, So we\'ll do a full breathing test. OK. OK. On the results, let me see she put it in the chart, OK.\n\n    Ensure all medical terms are accurate and contextualized for a professional allergist.

    "chief_complaint": "Persistent gastrointestinal symptoms including bloating and nausea over the last six months, with a recent interest in identifying additional food allergies.",
    "history_of_present_illness": "The patient, a 35-year-old female, reports a six-month history of gastrointestinal symptoms including bloating and nausea. She was diagnosed with celiac disease in 2011 and has been managing it with a gluten-free diet. Recent blood work identified allergies to cow's milk (0.10), dairy (0.11), and shrimp (0.37), prompting her to seek further testing for other potential food allergies. She has avoided dairy and shrimp for a few months without symptom improvement. The patient also mentions an episode of feeling unwell after consuming crab, though no immediate reaction was noted. Her symptoms do not seem to correlate directly with food intake, leading to ongoing investigations by her gastroenterologist and primary care physician. She has not experienced life-threatening reactions to any foods.",
    "past_medical_history": "Celiac disease diagnosed in 2011, asthma diagnosed long ago, one episode of pneumonia approximately 1.5 years ago. No history of eczema, recurrent sinusitis, bronchitis, or other significant hospitalizations or surgeries. She uses albuterol as needed for exercise-induced asthma and Flonase for seasonal allergies.",
    "allergies": "Cow's milk (0.10), dairy (0.11), shrimp (0.37), gluten (celiac disease). No known anaphylactic reactions. Current management includes avoidance of these allergens.",
    "social_history": "The patient is employed and lives with her family. No smoking or alcohol use reported. She exercises regularly, including running outdoors, which triggers her asthma symptoms. No significant environmental exposures noted.",

More data is needed to assess the effectiveness of the diet in managing mental and cognitive disorders and to establish a connection between the brain and gluten.', 'pubmed_id': '34836247', 'url': 'https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34836247/', 'confidence': 'Relevant', 'relevance_score': '27.5%', 'relevance_tag': 'Relevant to primary diagnosis: food intolerance or non-celiac gluten sensitivity', 'source': 'PubMed', 'authors': 'Bara Aljada, Ahmed Zohni, Wael El-Matary', 'year': '2021', 'raw_relevance_score': 27.500000000000004}

2025-05-20 14:23:51,847 [DEBUG] Semantic Scholar article abstract: Approximately 80% of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) patients report that their symptoms are triggered after ingesting one or specific food groups. Gluten, wheat and related proteins (e.g., amylase-trypsin inhibitors, and fermentable oligo-di-mono-saccharides and polyols (FODMAPs) are the most relevant IBS symptom triggers, although the true 'culprit(s)' is/are still not well established. The concept of causal relationship between gluten intake and the occurrence of symptoms in the absence of celiac disease and wheat allergy was termed non-celiac gluten sensitivity (NCGS). The borderline between celiac disease, wheat allergy, IBS and NCGS is not always clearly distinguishable, and the frequency and clinical identity of NGCS are still unclear. An overlap between IBS and NCGS has been detected. The incomplete knowledge of the etiopathogenesis of these clinical conditions, lack of data on their real epidemiology, as well as the absence of a gold standard for their diagnosis, make the overall picture difficult to understand "It is crucial to well define the interaction between IBS, food intolerance and NGCS, since the role of diet in IBS and its dietary management is an essential tool in the treatment of a large number of these patients". The objective of the present review is to provide an overview highlighting the interaction between IBS, food intolerance and NCGS in order to unravel whether gluten/wheat/FODMAP sensitivity represents 'facts' and not 'fiction' in IBS symptoms.

2025-05-20 16:32:21,572 [DEBUG] Semantic Scholar article title: BREATHLEssness in INDIA (BREATHE-INDIA): realist review to develop explanatory programme theory about breathlessness self-management in India
2025-05-20 16:32:21,572 [DEBUG] Semantic Scholar article abstract: Breathlessness is highly prevalent in low and middle-income countries (LMICs). Low-cost, non-drug, breathlessness self-management interventions are effective in high-income countries. However, health beliefs influence acceptability and have not been explored in LMIC settings. Review with stakeholder engagement to co-develop explanatory programme theories for whom, if, and how breathlessness self-management might work in community settings in India. Iterative and systematic searches identified peer-reviewed articles, policy and media, and expert-identified sources. Data were extracted in terms of contribution to theory (high, medium, low), and theories developed with stakeholder groups (doctors, nurses and allied professionals, people with lived experiences, lay health workers) and an International Steering Group (RAMESES guidelines (PROSPERO42022375768)). One hundred and four data sources and 11 stakeholder workshops produced 8 initial programme theories and 3 consolidated programme theories. (1) Context: breathlessness is common due to illness, environment, and lifestyle. Cultural beliefs shape misunderstandings about breathlessness; hereditary, part of aging, linked to asthma. It is stigmatised and poorly understood as a treatable issue. People often use rest, incense, or tea, while avoiding physical activity due to fear of worsening breathlessness. Trusted voices, such as healthcare workers and community members, can help address misconceptions with clear, simple messages. (2) Breathlessness intervention applicability: nonpharmacological interventions can work across different contexts when they address unhelpful beliefs and behaviours. Introducing concepts like “too much rest leads to deconditioning” aligns with cultural norms while promoting beneficial behavioural changes, such as gradual physical activity. Acknowledging breathlessness as a medical issue is key to improving patient and family well-being. (3) Implementation: community-based healthcare workers are trusted but need simple, low-cost resources/skills integrated into existing training. Education should focus on managing acute episodes and daily breathlessness, reducing fear, and encouraging behavioural change. Evidence-based tools are vital to gain support from policymakers and expand implementation. Breathlessness management in India must integrate symptom management alongside public health and disease treatment strategies. Self-management interventions can be implemented in an LMIC setting. However, our novel methods indicate that understanding the context for implementation is essential so that unhelpful health beliefs can be addressed at the point of intervention delivery.

2025-05-20 16:32:22,441 [DEBUG] Semantic Scholar article abstract: Vitiated Vata Dosha, weakened Agni, and accumulation of Ama at Shleshmic Sthana mainly at Sandhi (joints) are responsible for the development of Aamvata. Amavata can be correlated with Rheumatoid Arthritis due to similarities in clinical symtoms. Rheumatoid arthritis is one among the autoimmune diseases causing chronic symmetrical polyarthritis. The treatment in Modern science includes the use of NSAID’s (Non steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs), DMARD’s (Disease-Modifying Antirheumatic Drugs), glucocorticoids, and immune-suppressants, long-term use of which causes several side effects. Ayurveda treatment procedures and medication used for the treatment of Amavata have Agni Deepana, Ama Pachana, Vata Shamaka, Sroto shodhana actions which are helpful to retard disease process and reduce signs and symptoms of the disease. In the present case, 65-year female patient presented with, complaints of multiple joint pain with swelling and morning stiffness, restricted joint movements, loss of appetite, fatigue, weakness, fever (on and off), migratory pain, and symmetrical joint involvement. Patient was administered with Phalatrikadiguggulu, Shwadanshtradi guggulu. Mahayograjguggulu, Rasapachak vati, Sameerpannag rasa and Gandharvaharitaki churna added as Nitya Virechana. Ruksha Swedan with Valukapottali had also been given. The therapeutic interventions adopted in the study have shown beneficial effects in the patients of Aamvata.

Amavata can be correlated with Rheumatoid Arthritis due to similarities in clinical symtoms. Rheumatoid arthritis is one among the autoimmune diseases causing chronic symmetrical polyarthritis. The treatment in Modern science includes the use of NSAID’s (Non steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs), DMARD’s (Disease-Modifying Antirheumatic Drugs), glucocorticoids, and immune-suppressants, long-term use of which causes several side effects. Ayurveda treatment procedures and medication used for the treatment of Amavata have Agni Deepana, Ama Pachana, Vata Shamaka, Sroto shodhana actions which are helpful to retard disease process and reduce signs and symptoms of the disease. In the present case, 65-year female patient presented with, complaints of multiple joint pain with swelling and morning stiffness, restricted joint movements, loss of appetite, fatigue, weakness, fever (on and off), migratory pain, and symmetrical joint involvement.

2025-05-20 16:32:37,662 [DEBUG] PubMed article title: The clinical features of rheumatoid arthritis.
2025-05-20 16:32:37,662 [DEBUG] PubMed article abstract: Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic inflammatory disease characterized by progressive damage of synovial-lined joints and variable extra-articular manifestations. Tendon and bursal involvement are frequent and often clinically dominant in early disease. RA can affect any joint, but it is usually found in metacarpophalangeal, proximal interphalangeal and metatarsophalangeal joints, as well as in the wrists and knee. Articular and periarticular manifestations include joint swelling and tenderness to palpation, with morning stiffness and severe motion impairment in the involved joints. The clinical presentation of RA varies, but an insidious onset of pain with symmetric swelling of small joints is the most frequent finding. RA onset is acute or subacute in about 25% of patients, but its patterns of presentation also include palindromic onset, monoarticular presentation (both slow and acute forms), extra-articular synovitis (tenosynovitis, bursitis), polymyalgic-like onset, and general symptoms (malaise, fatigue, weight loss, fever). The palindromic onset is characterized by recurrent episodes of oligoarthritis with no residual radiologic damage, while the polymyalgic-like onset may be clinically indistinguishable from polymyalgia rheumatica in elderly subjects. RA is characteristically a symmetric erosive disease. Although any joint, including the cricoarytenoid joint, can be affected, the distal interphalangeal, the sacroiliac, and the lumbar spine joints are rarely involved. The clinical features of synovitis are particularly apparent in the morning. Morning stiffness in and around the joints, lasting at least 1 h before maximal improvement is a typical sign of RA. It is a subjective sign and the patient needs to be carefully informed as to the difference between pain and stiffness. Morning stiffness duration is related to disease activity. Hand involvement is the typical early manifestation of rheumatoid arthritis. Synovitis involving the metacarpophalangeal, proximal interphalangeal and wrist joints causes a characteristic tender swelling on palpation with early severe motion impairment and no radiologic evidence of bone damage. Fatigue, feveret, weight loss, and malaise are frequent clinical signs which can be associated with variable manifestations of extra-articular involvement such as rheumatoid nodules, vasculitis, hematologic abnormalities, Felty's syndrome, and visceral involvement. Although there is no laboratory test to exclude or prove the diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis, several laboratory abnormalities can be detected. Abnormal values of the tests for evaluation of systemic inflammation are the most typical humoral features of RA. These include: erythrocyte sedimentation rate, acute phase proteins and plasma viscosity.

2025-05-20 16:32:37,663 [DEBUG] PubMed article abstract: Key principles of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) management include early patient evaluation by a rheumatologist and early initiation of pharmacologic therapy in patients at risk for chronic disease. Early diagnosis and appropriate management are essential to prevent joint damage. Patients with RA usually report pain and swelling in multiple joints and prolonged stiffness in the morning that improves with activity. Joint involvement typically is bilateral and symmetric. RA affects large and small joints, particularly the metacarpophalangeal and proximal interphalangeal joints of the hands. Patients with RA may be started on nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, glucocorticoids, or conventional synthetic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) before evaluation by a rheumatologist. Patients who have a poor response to conventional synthetic DMARDs or aggressive arthritis at initial evaluation may be prescribed biologic or targeted synthetic DMARDs. Anti-tumor necrosis factor alpha agents also may be used. Patients typically are managed with a treat-to-target strategy to achieve and maintain low disease activity or remission. Regular monitoring visits using formal assessment of disease activity have been shown to improve outcomes. RA and the medications used in its treatment are associated with increased risks of infections and malignancy. Integrative medicine therapies with limited evidence include acupuncture, mind-body therapies (eg, yoga, tai chi), and dietary supplements.

RA affects large and small joints, particularly the metacarpophalangeal and proximal interphalangeal joints of the hands. Patients with RA may be started on nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, glucocorticoids, or conventional synthetic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) before evaluation by a rheumatologist. Patients who have a poor response to conventional synthetic DMARDs or aggressive arthritis at initial evaluation may be prescribed biologic or targeted synthetic DMARDs. Anti-tumor necrosis factor alpha agents also may be used. Patients typically are managed with a treat-to-target strategy to achieve and maintain low disease activity or remission.

2025-05-20 16:33:17,758 [DEBUG] Semantic Scholar article abstract: Approximately 80% of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) patients report that their symptoms are triggered after ingesting one or specific food groups. Gluten, wheat and related proteins (e.g., amylase-trypsin inhibitors, and fermentable oligo-di-mono-saccharides and polyols (FODMAPs) are the most relevant IBS symptom triggers, although the true 'culprit(s)' is/are still not well established. The concept of causal relationship between gluten intake and the occurrence of symptoms in the absence of celiac disease and wheat allergy was termed non-celiac gluten sensitivity (NCGS). The borderline between celiac disease, wheat allergy, IBS and NCGS is not always clearly distinguishable, and the frequency and clinical identity of NGCS are still unclear. An overlap between IBS and NCGS has been detected. The incomplete knowledge of the etiopathogenesis of these clinical conditions, lack of data on their real epidemiology, as well as the absence of a gold standard for their diagnosis, make the overall picture difficult to understand "It is crucial to well define the interaction between IBS, food intolerance and NGCS, since the role of diet in IBS and its dietary management is an essential tool in the treatment of a large number of these patients". The objective of the present review is to provide an overview highlighting the interaction between IBS, food intolerance and NCGS in order to unravel whether gluten/wheat/FODMAP sensitivity represents 'facts' and not 'fiction' in IBS symptoms.

2025-05-20 16:58:42,054 [DEBUG] PubMed article abstract: Lactose is the main source of calories in milk, an essential nutriedigestion, patients with visceral hypersensitivity nt in infancy and a key part of the diet in populations that maintain the ability to digest this disaccharide in adulthood. Lactase deficiency (LD) is the failure to express the enzyme that hydrolyses lactose into galactose and glucose in the small intestine. The genetic mechanism of lactase persistence in adult Caucasians is mediated by a single C→T nucleotide polymorphism at the LCTbo -13'910 locus on chromosome-2. Lactose malabsorption (LM) refers to any cause of failure to digest and/or absorb lactose in the small intestine. This includes primary genetic and also secondary LD due to infection or other conditions that affect the mucosal integrity of the small bowel. Lactose intolerance (LI) is defined as the onset of abdominal symptoms such as abdominal pain, bloating and diarrhoea after lactose ingestion by an individual with LM. The likelihood of LI depends on the lactose dose, lactase expression and the intestinal microbiome. Independent of lactose digestion, patients with visceral hypersensitivity associated with anxiety or the Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS) are at increased risk of the condition. Diagnostic investigations available to diagnose LM and LI include genetic, endoscopic and physiological tests. The association between self-reported LI, objective findings and clinical outcome of dietary intervention is variable. Treatment of LI can include low-lactose diet, lactase supplementation and, potentially, colonic adaptation by prebiotics. The clinical outcome of these treatments is modest, because lactose is just one of a number of poorly absorbed carbohydrates which can cause symptoms by similar mechanisms.

2025-05-20 16:58:42,055 [DEBUG] PubMed article title: Lactose Intolerance in Adults: Biological Mechanism and Dietary Management.
2025-05-20 16:58:42,055 [DEBUG] PubMed article abstract: Lactose intolerance related to primary or secondary lactase deficiency is characterized by abdominal pain and distension, borborygmi, flatus, and diarrhea induced by lactose in dairy products. The biological mechanism and lactose malabsorption is established and several investigations are available, including genetic, endoscopic and physiological tests. Lactose intolerance depends not only on the expression of lactase but also on the dose of lactose, intestinal flora, gastrointestinal motility, small intestinal bacterial overgrowth and sensitivity of the gastrointestinal tract to the generation of gas and other fermentation products of lactose digestion. Treatment of lactose intolerance can include lactose-reduced diet and enzyme replacement. This is effective if symptoms are only related to dairy products; however, lactose intolerance can be part of a wider intolerance to variably absorbed, fermentable oligo-, di-, monosaccharides and polyols (FODMAPs). This is present in at least half of patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and this group requires not only restriction of lactose intake but also a low FODMAP diet to improve gastrointestinal complaints. The long-term effects of a dairy-free, low FODMAPs diet on nutritional health and the fecal microbiome are not well defined. This review summarizes recent advances in our understanding of the genetic basis, biological mechanism, diagnosis and dietary management of lactose intolerance.

The present work aims to review indications, proven benefits, and adverse events of a gluten-free diet. Close follow-up with patients following the diet is recommended. More data is needed to assess the effectiveness of the diet in managing mental and cognitive disorders and to establish a connection between the brain and gluten.

2025-05-20 16:58:56,906 [DEBUG] Semantic Scholar article title: IRRITABLE BOWEL SYNDROME, FOOD INTOLERANCE AND NON- CELIAC GLUTEN SENSITIVITY. A NEW CLINICAL CHALLENGE.
2025-05-20 16:58:56,906 [DEBUG] Semantic Scholar article abstract: Approximately 80% of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) patients report that their symptoms are triggered after ingesting one or specific food groups. Gluten, wheat and related proteins (e.g., amylase-trypsin inhibitors, and fermentable oligo-di-mono-saccharides and polyols (FODMAPs) are the most relevant IBS symptom triggers, although the true 'culprit(s)' is/are still not well established. The concept of causal relationship between gluten intake and the occurrence of symptoms in the absence of celiac disease and wheat allergy was termed non-celiac gluten sensitivity (NCGS). The borderline between celiac disease, wheat allergy, IBS and NCGS is not always clearly distinguishable, and the frequency and clinical identity of NGCS are still unclear. An overlap between IBS and NCGS has been detected. The incomplete knowledge of the etiopathogenesis of these clinical conditions, lack of data on their real epidemiology, as well as the absence of a gold standard for their diagnosis, make the overall picture difficult to understand "It is crucial to well define the interaction between IBS, food intolerance and NGCS, since the role of diet in IBS and its dietary management is an essential tool in the treatment of a large number of these patients". The objective of the present review is to provide an overview highlighting the interaction between IBS, food intolerance and NCGS in order to unravel whether gluten/wheat/FODMAP sensitivity represents 'facts' and not 'fiction' in IBS symptoms.

2025-05-20 17:33:19,269 [DEBUG] PubMed article abstract: There is a frequently encountered subset of hypothyroid patients who are refractory to standard thyroid hormone replacement treatment and require unexpectedly high doses of levothyroxine. In addition to clinical situations where hypothyroid patients are non-compliant, or where there is the possibility of excipient-induced disease exacerbation (gluten/celiac disease), therapeutic failure may be due to impaired absorption of the administered drug. The common approach to managing patients with unusual thyroxine needs is to escalate the dose of levothyroxine until targeted TSH levels are achieved. This approach can increase the risk for prolonged exposure to supratherapeutic doses of levothyroxine, which increase the chances of adverse outcomes. Repeated adjustments of levothyroxine can also escalate the costs of treatment, as frequent office visits and laboratory tests are required to determine and maintain the desired dose. Clinicians should take a systematic approach to managing patients whom they suspect of having treatment-refractory hypothyroidism. This may include searching for, and adjusting, occult medical conditions and/or other factors that may affect the absorption of levothyroxine, before up-titrating the dose of traditional levothyroxine therapy.

Less appreciated is that depression's tremendous burdens are not shared equally among all who become depressed. Some will suffer recurrences over the rest of their lives, whereas half or more will never have a recurrence. Based on these two distinctive life course prototypes, we propose a subtype distinction for research on the origins and lifetime course of major depression. A pressing goal is to determine at the time of depression's first onset who will follow which clinical trajectory. The lack of recognition of this distinction has resulted in many obstacles, including conceptual biases, methodological oversights, and definitional dead ends. Current theories are reviewed and compared. The implications for contemporary diagnostic controversies, reevaluating research on treatment and prevention, and enhancing the predictive strength of traditionally weak indicators of recurrences and recurrent depression are discussed.

2025-05-20 17:33:29,607 [DEBUG] PubMed article title: Calcium and/or Vitamin D Supplementation for the Prevention of Fragility Fractures: Who Needs It?
2025-05-20 17:33:29,608 [DEBUG] PubMed article abstract: Vitamin D and calcium have different biological functions, so the need for supplementation, and its safety and efficacy, need to be evaluated for each separately. Vitamin D deficiency is usually the result of low sunlight exposure (e.g., in frail older people, those who are veiled, those with dark-skin living at higher latitudes) and is reversible with calciferol 400-800 IU/day. Calcium supplements produce a 1% increase in bone density in the first year of use, without further increases subsequently. Vitamin D supplements do not improve bone density in clinical trials except in analyses of subgroups with baseline levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D <30 nmol/L. Supplementation with calcium, vitamin D, or their combination does not prevent fractures in community-dwelling adults, but a large study in vitamin D-deficient nursing home residents did demonstrate fracture prevention. When treating osteoporosis, co-administration of calcium with anti-resorptive drugs has not been shown to impact on treatment efficacy. Correction of severe vitamin D deficiency (<25 nmol/L) is necessary before use of potent anti-resorptive drugs to avoid hypocalcemia. Calcium supplements cause gastrointestinal side effects, particularly constipation, and increase the risk of kidney stones and, probably, heart attacks by about 20%. Low-dose vitamin D is safe, but doses >4000 IU/day have been associated with more falls and fractures. Current evidence does not support use of either calcium or vitamin D supplements in healthy community-dwelling adults.

This approach can increase the risk for prolonged exposure to supratherapeutic doses of levothyroxine, which increase the chances of adverse outcomes. Repeated adjustments of levothyroxine can also escalate the costs of treatment, as frequent office visits and laboratory tests are required to determine and maintain the desired dose. Clinicians should take a systematic approach to managing patients whom they suspect of having treatment-refractory hypothyroidism. This may include searching for, and adjusting, occult medical conditions and/or other factors that may affect the absorption of levothyroxine, before up-titrating the dose of traditional levothyroxine therapy. Depending on the underlying pathology, another approach that may be considered is to try alternative formulations of levothyroxine that are less susceptible to intolerance issues related to excipients, or, in some cases, to malabsorption.

Vitamin D deficiency is usually the result of low sunlight exposure (e.g., in frail older people, those who are veiled, those with dark-skin living at higher latitudes) and is reversible with calciferol 400-800 IU/day. Calcium supplements produce a 1% increase in bone density in the first year of use, without further increases subsequently. Vitamin D supplements do not improve bone density in clinical trials except in analyses of subgroups with baseline levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D <30 nmol/L. Supplementation with calcium, vitamin D, or their combination does not prevent fractures in community-dwelling adults, but a large study in vitamin D-deficient nursing home residents did demonstrate fracture prevention. When treating osteoporosis, co-administration of calcium with anti-resorptive drugs has not been shown to impact on treatment efficacy. Correction of severe vitamin D deficiency (<25 nmol/L) is necessary before use of potent anti-resorptive drugs to avoid hypocalcemia. Calcium supplements cause gastrointestinal side effects, particularly constipation, and increase the risk of kidney stones and, probably, heart attacks by about 20%. Low-dose vitamin D is safe, but doses >4000 IU/day have been associated with more falls and fractures.

Amavata can be correlated with Rheumatoid Arthritis due to similarities in clinical symtoms. Rheumatoid arthritis is one among the autoimmune diseases causing chronic symmetrical polyarthritis. The treatment in Modern science includes the use of NSAID’s (Non steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs), DMARD’s (Disease-Modifying Antirheumatic Drugs), glucocorticoids, and immune-suppressants, long-term use of which causes several side effects. Ayurveda treatment procedures and medication used for the treatment of Amavata have Agni Deepana, Ama Pachana, Vata Shamaka, Sroto shodhana actions which are helpful to retard disease process and reduce signs and symptoms of the disease. In the present case, 65-year female patient presented with, complaints of multiple joint pain with swelling and morning stiffness, restricted joint movements, loss of appetite, fatigue, weakness, fever (on and off), migratory pain, and symmetrical joint involvement. Patient was administered with Phalatrikadiguggulu, Shwadanshtradi guggulu. Mahayograjguggulu, Rasapachak vati, Sameerpannag rasa and Gandharvaharitaki churna added as Nitya Virechana. Ruksha Swedan with Valukapottali had also been given. The therapeutic interventions adopted in the study have shown beneficial effects in the patients of Aamvata.

The treatment in Modern science includes the use of NSAID\u2019s (Non steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs), DMARD\u2019s (Disease-Modifying Antirheumatic Drugs), glucocorticoids, and immune-suppressants, long-term use of which causes several side effects. Ayurveda treatment procedures and medication used for the treatment of Amavata have Agni Deepana, Ama Pachana, Vata Shamaka, Sroto shodhana actions which are helpful to retard disease process and reduce signs and symptoms of the disease.

2025-05-20 19:06:44,522 [DEBUG] Semantic Scholar article title: BREATHLEssness in INDIA (BREATHE-INDIA): realist review to develop explanatory programme theory about breathlessness self-management in India
2025-05-20 19:06:44,522 [DEBUG] Semantic Scholar article abstract: Breathlessness is highly prevalent in low and middle-income countries (LMICs). Low-cost, non-drug, breathlessness self-management interventions are effective in high-income countries. However, health beliefs influence acceptability and have not been explored in LMIC settings. Review with stakeholder engagement to co-develop explanatory programme theories for whom, if, and how breathlessness self-management might work in community settings in India. Iterative and systematic searches identified peer-reviewed articles, policy and media, and expert-identified sources. Data were extracted in terms of contribution to theory (high, medium, low), and theories developed with stakeholder groups (doctors, nurses and allied professionals, people with lived experiences, lay health workers) and an International Steering Group (RAMESES guidelines (PROSPERO42022375768)). One hundred and four data sources and 11 stakeholder workshops produced 8 initial programme theories and 3 consolidated programme theories. (1) Context: breathlessness is common due to illness, environment, and lifestyle. Cultural beliefs shape misunderstandings about breathlessness; hereditary, part of aging, linked to asthma. It is stigmatised and poorly understood as a treatable issue. People often use rest, incense, or tea, while avoiding physical activity due to fear of worsening breathlessness. Trusted voices, such as healthcare workers and community members, can help address misconceptions with clear, simple messages. (2) Breathlessness intervention applicability: nonpharmacological interventions can work across different contexts when they address unhelpful beliefs and behaviours. Introducing concepts like “too much rest leads to deconditioning” aligns with cultural norms while promoting beneficial behavioural changes, such as gradual physical activity. Acknowledging breathlessness as a medical issue is key to improving patient and family well-being. (3) Implementation: community-based healthcare workers are trusted but need simple, low-cost resources/skills integrated into existing training. Education should focus on managing acute episodes and daily breathlessness, reducing fear, and encouraging behavioural change. Evidence-based tools are vital to gain support from policymakers and expand implementation. Breathlessness management in India must integrate symptom management alongside public health and disease treatment strategies. Self-management interventions can be implemented in an LMIC setting. However, our novel methods indicate that understanding the context for implementation is essential so that unhelpful health beliefs can be addressed at the point of intervention delivery.

2025-05-21 00:13:24,970 [DEBUG] PubMed article abstract: Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic inflammatory disease characterized by progressive damage of synovial-lined joints and variable extra-articular manifestations. Tendon and bursal involvement are frequent and often clinically dominant in early disease. RA can affect any joint, but it is usually found in metacarpophalangeal, proximal interphalangeal and metatarsophalangeal joints, as well as in the wrists and knee. Articular and periarticular manifestations include joint swelling and tenderness to palpation, with morning stiffness and severe motion impairment in the involved joints. The clinical presentation of RA varies, but an insidious onset of pain with symmetric swelling of small joints is the most frequent finding. RA onset is acute or subacute in about 25% of patients, but its patterns of presentation also include palindromic onset, monoarticular presentation (both slow and acute forms), extra-articular synovitis (tenosynovitis, bursitis), polymyalgic-like onset, and general symptoms (malaise, fatigue, weight loss, fever). The palindromic onset is characterized by recurrent episodes of oligoarthritis with no residual radiologic damage, while the polymyalgic-like onset may be clinically indistinguishable from polymyalgia rheumatica in elderly subjects. RA is characteristically a symmetric erosive disease. Although any joint, including the cricoarytenoid joint, can be affected, the distal interphalangeal, the sacroiliac, and the lumbar spine joints are rarely involved. The clinical features of synovitis are particularly apparent in the morning. Morning stiffness in and around the joints, lasting at least 1 h before maximal improvement is a typical sign of RA. It is a subjective sign and the patient needs to be carefully informed as to the difference between pain and stiffness. Morning stiffness duration is related to disease activity. Hand involvement is the typical early manifestation of rheumatoid arthritis. Synovitis involving the metacarpophalangeal, proximal interphalangeal and wrist joints causes a characteristic tender swelling on palpation with early severe motion impairment and no radiologic evidence of bone damage. Fatigue, feveret, weight loss, and malaise are frequent clinical signs which can be associated with variable manifestations of extra-articular involvement such as rheumatoid nodules, vasculitis, hematologic abnormalities, Felty's syndrome, and visceral involvement. Although there is no laboratory test to exclude or prove the diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis, several laboratory abnormalities can be detected. Abnormal values of the tests for evaluation of systemic inflammation are the most typical humoral features of RA. These include: erythrocyte sedimentation rate, acute phase proteins and plasma viscosity. Erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein provide the best information about the acute phase response. The C-reactive protein is strictly correlated with clinical assessment and radiographic changes. Plain film radiography is the standard investigation to assess the extent of anatomic changes in rheumatoid arthritis patients. The radiographic features of the hand joints in early disease are characterized by soft tissue swelling and mild juxtaarticular osteoporosis. In the the past 10 years, ultrasonography has gained acceptance for studying joint, tendon and bursal involvement in RA. It may improve the early clinical assessment and the follow-up of these patients, showing such details as synovial thickening even within finger joints. Other imaging techniques, such as magnetic resonance, computed tomography and scintigraphy may provide useful information about both the features and the extent for anatomic damage in selected rheumatoid arthritis patients. The natural history of the disease is poorly defined; its clinical course is fluctuating and the prognosis unpredictable. RA is an epidemiologically relevant cause of disability. An adequate early treatment of RA may alter the diseas

Tendon and bursal involvement are frequent and often clinically dominant in early disease. RA can affect any joint, but it is usually found in metacarpophalangeal, proximal interphalangeal and metatarsophalangeal joints, as well as in the wrists and knee. Articular and periarticular manifestations include joint swelling and tenderness to palpation, with morning stiffness and severe motion impairment in the involved joints. The clinical presentation of RA varies, but an insidious onset of pain with symmetric swelling of small joints is the most frequent finding. RA onset is acute or subacute in about 25% of patients, but its patterns of presentation also include palindromic onset, monoarticular presentation (both slow and acute forms), extra-articular synovitis (tenosynovitis, bursitis), polymyalgic-like onset, and general symptoms (malaise, fatigue, weight loss, fever). The palindromic onset is characterized by recurrent episodes of oligoarthritis with no residual radiologic damage, while the polymyalgic-like onset may be clinically indistinguishable from polymyalgia rheumatica in elderly subjects. RA is characteristically a symmetric erosive disease. Although any joint, including the cricoarytenoid joint, can be affected, the distal interphalangeal, the sacroiliac, and the lumbar spine joints are rarely involved. The clinical features of synovitis are particularly apparent in the morning. Morning stiffness in and around the joints, lasting at least 1 h before maximal improvement is a typical sign of RA. It is a subjective sign and the patient needs to be carefully informed as to the difference between pain and stiffness. Morning stiffness duration is related to disease activity. Hand involvement is the typical early manifestation of rheumatoid arthritis. Synovitis involving the metacarpophalangeal, proximal interphalangeal and wrist joints causes a characteristic tender swelling on palpation with early severe motion impairment and no radiologic evidence of bone damage. Fatigue, feveret, weight loss, and malaise are frequent clinical signs which can be associated with variable manifestations of extra-articular involvement such as rheumatoid nodules, vasculitis, hematologic abnormalities, Felty's syndrome, and visceral involvement.

Tell me, what\'s been going on?"\n"Morning, Dr. Ellis. It\'s… it\'s a lot. For the past six, maybe eight months, I\'ve been feeling this overwhelming fatigue. Not just tired, Doctor, but like my bones are made of lead. And I\'ve been getting these strange rashes, mostly on my arms and chest. They come and go, sometimes itchy, sometimes just red patches. My wife noticed I\'ve been more short of breath lately too, especially when I climb the stairs. And then there are the joint pains – my knees, my wrists, sometimes my fingers. They’re stiff in the morning, and they ache pretty much all day. I\'ve also had a couple of episodes where I felt like my heart was racing, just out of the blue, even when I was sitting down. Oh, and I\'ve lost a bit of weight without trying, maybe ten pounds."\n"Okay, Mr. Harrison, that is quite a constellation of symptoms. Let\'s break this down. The fatigue, you said it\'s debilitating?"\n"Yes, absolutely. I used to be quite active, but now even a short walk feels like a marathon."\n"And the rashes – can you describe them a bit more? Are they raised? Scaly?"\n"Sometimes they’re slightly raised, other times flat. Not really scaly, more like… blotchy. And they seem to worsen after I\'ve been out in the sun, even for a short while."\n"Sun sensitivity, noted. The shortness of breath – is it accompanied by any chest pain or wheezing?"\n"No distinct chest pain when I\'m breathless, more like a tightness. No wheezing that I\'ve noticed."\n"And the joint pain – is it symmetrical, meaning it affects both sides, say both knees or both wrists, fairly equally?"\n"Yes, I\'d say so. When my right knee flares up, the left one isn\'t far behind. Same with my hands."\n"Have you noticed any swelling in the joints?"\n"Yes, sometimes my fingers and knuckles look a bit puffy, especially in the morning."\n"Alright. And the heart palpitations – how long do those episodes last? Any dizziness or fainting associated with them?"\n"They can last a few minutes, maybe up to ten. I do feel a bit lightheaded during them, but I haven\'t fainted."\n"Any other symptoms? Fevers? Swollen glands? Mouth sores? Hair loss?"\n"Now that you mention it, I have had a couple of mouth ulcers that were quite painful. And my hair seems thinner than it used to be, but I just put that down to getting older."\n"Okay, Mr. Harrison. Based on what you\'re describing – the multisystem involvement including the skin, joints, fatigue, shortness of breath, and photosensitivity, along with the mouth ulcers and possible hair thinning – we need to consider a few possibilities. One of the conditions that comes to mind, given this pattern, is an autoimmune process, something like systemic lupus erythematosus, or SLE. This is a condition where the body\'s immune system mistakenly attacks its own healthy tissues and organs. It can affect many different parts of the body, which would explain the wide range of symptoms you\'re experiencing."\n"Lupus? I\'ve heard of it. That sounds serious."\n"It can be, but it\'s also a manageable condition for many people. The key is getting an accurate diagnosis and starting appropriate treatment. The symptoms you\'re describing, such as the malar rash or butterfly rash which can be sun-sensitive, the arthritis, pleuritis or pericarditis which could explain the shortness of breath and palpitations, and the hematologic and neurologic aspects we haven’t fully explored yet, are all potential criteria. To investigate this further, I\'d like to order a series of blood tests. We\'ll need to look for specific autoantibodies, like an ANA, or antinuclear antibody, anti-dsDNA, and anti-Smith antibodies, which are often present in SLE. We\'ll also check your inflammatory markers, kidney and liver function, and a complete blood count. Depending on those results, we might also consider imaging, perhaps a chest X-ray or an echocardiogram to assess your heart and lungs more closely. It’s important we rule out other conditions as well, such as rheumatoid arthritis, Sjogren’s syndrome, or even certain infections that can mimic these symptoms, though the constellation you present is quite suggestive. For now, I want you to keep a detailed symptom diary – note any new rashes, joint pain flare-ups, episodes of breathlessness or palpitations, and any potential triggers you notice, especially sun exposure. This will be very helpful as we move forward."\n"Okay, Doctor. That\'s a lot to take in. So, blood tests first."\n"Yes. We\'ll get those drawn today if you have the time. We need to gather more information to piece this puzzle together. It\'s a complex picture, Mr. Harrison, but we\'ll work through it systematically."\n"I appreciate that, Dr. Ellis. Thank you."\n"You\'re welcome. We\'ll schedule a follow-up to discuss the results as soon as they\'re available. My nurse will give you the lab forms and help you with scheduling."\n\n    Ensure all medical terms are accurate and contextualized for a professional allergist. Include specific details (e.g., medication names with exact dosages, test types). Avoid speculative diagnoses; flag uncertainty for human review. For the enhanced_recommendations section, be exceptionally thorough and specific, providing detailed actionable insights based on current clinical guidelines and evidence-based best practices. Include precise timelines and measurable outcomes where appropriate.\n\n    Output in JSON format:\n    {\n        "patient_history": {\n            "chief_complaint": "string",\n            "history_of_present_illness": "string",\n            "past_medical_history": "string",\n            "allergies": "string",\n            "social_history": "string",\n            "review_of_systems": "string"\n        },\n        "physical_examination": "string",\n        "differential_diagnosis": "string",\n        "diagnostic_workup": "string",\n        "plan_of_care": "string",\n        "patient_education": "string",\n        "follow_up_instructions": "string",\n        "summary": "string",\n        "enhanced_recommendations": "string"\n    }\n    '}], 'max_tokens': 2500, 'temperature': 0.25}

Lifestyle Modifications:\n   - Environmental controls: Use sunscreen with SPF 30 or higher, wear protective clothing, and avoid peak sun hours to manage photosensitivity.\n   - Trigger avoidance: Keep a detailed symptom diary to identify and avoid potential triggers, especially sun exposure.\n   - Dietary adjustments: Maintain a balanced diet rich in anti-inflammatory foods such as omega-3 fatty acids (e.g., fish, flaxseeds) and antioxidants (e.g., berries, leafy greens).\n   - Exercise: Engage in low-impact exercises like swimming or walking to manage fatigue and joint pain, but avoid overexertion.\n   - Stress management: Practice mindfulness techniques such as meditation or yoga to help manage stress, which can exacerbate autoimmune symptoms.\n\n3. Monitoring Protocol:\n   - Monitor symptoms: Track fatigue, rashes, joint pain, shortness of breath, and palpitations daily in a symptom diary.\n   - Vital signs: Regularly check blood pressure and heart rate, especially during episodes of palpitations.\n   - Frequency: Daily monitoring of symptoms, weekly review of trends.\n   - Thresholds: Contact healthcare provider if symptoms worsen significantly or new symptoms develop.\n   - Tools: Use a smartphone app for symptom tracking or a physical diary.\n   - Documentation: Maintain a detailed record of symptoms, triggers, and medication adherence.\n\n4. Emergency Action Plan:\n   - Acute exacerbations: If experiencing severe shortness of breath, chest pain, or severe joint swelling, seek immediate medical attention.\n   - Indicators for emergency care: Severe symptoms not responding to usual treatments, signs of organ involvement (e.g., kidney failure).\n   - Emergency medication: Use prednisone 40 mg orally as a rescue dose if prescribed, and seek medical attention immediately.\n   - Instructions for caregivers: Monitor for signs of severe symptoms and assist in seeking emergency care if necessary.\n\n5. Long-term Management Strategy:\n   - Reassessment: Schedule reassessment every 3 months initially, then every 6 months once stable.\n   - Goals: Achieve symptom control, prevent flares, and maintain quality of life.\n   - Future options: Consider biologics such as belimumab if SLE is confirmed and not responding to initial therapy.\n   - Success criteria: Reduction in symptom frequency and severity, improved quality of life, and no organ damage.\n   - Referrals: Consider referral to a rheumatologist for specialized management if SLE or rheumatoid arthritis is confirmed.\n\n6. Patient Education Resources:\n   - Educational materials: 'Understanding Lupus' by the Lupus Foundation of America, 'Living Well with Rheumatoid Arthritis' by the Arthritis Foundation.\n   - Support groups: Local lupus support groups (contact information to be provided by the clinic).\n   - Online resources: Lupus.org, Arthritis.org, and MayoClinic.org for reliable information.\n   - Mobile applications: 'My Lupus Log' for symptom tracking and management.\n\n7. Follow-up Schedule:\n   - Timing: Follow-up in 2 weeks to review blood test results, then every 3 months initially.\n   - Tests: Bring results of all ordered tests to the follow-up appointment.\n   - Information: Bring the symptom diary and any new symptoms or concerns.\n   - Expectations: Aim for symptom control and prevention of flares, with adjustments to the treatment plan as needed.",
  "recommendations": "1. Medication Management:\n   - Hydroxychloroquine: 200 mg orally once daily. Monitor for potential side effects such as retinal toxicity, requiring regular ophthalmologic exams.\n   - Prednisone: 5-10 mg daily if severe symptoms, with a tapering schedule to minimize long-term side effects. Monitor for hyperglycemia, weight gain, and bone density changes.\n   - Methotrexate: 15 mg weekly, with folic acid 1 mg daily except on the day of methotrexate administration. Monitor for liver function and potential bone marrow suppression.\n   - Medication interactions: Hydroxychloroquine can interact with digoxin and antacids; prednisone can interact with NSAIDs and anticoagulants; methotrexate can interact with NSAIDs and certain antibiotics.\n   - Adjust medications based on symptom severity: Increase prednisone dose if symptoms flare, but consider tapering as soon as possible. Adjust methotrexate dose based on response and side effects.\n   - Rationale: Hydroxychloroquine is a first-line treatment for SLE due to its efficacy in managing symptoms and preventing flares.

2025-05-21 13:16:58,322 [DEBUG] PubMed article abstract: Pericarditis refers to the inflammation of the pericardial layers, resulting from a variety of stimuli triggering a stereotyped immune response, and characterized by chest pain associated often with peculiar electrocardiographic changes and, at times, accompanied by pericardial effusion. Acute pericarditis is generally self-limited and not life-threatening; yet, it may cause significant short-term disability, be complicated by either a large pericardial effusion or tamponade, and carry a significant risk of recurrence. The mainstay of treatment of pericarditis is represented by anti-inflammatory drugs. Anti-inflammatory treatments vary, however, in both effectiveness and side-effect profile. The objective of this review is to summarize the up-to-date management of acute and recurrent pericarditis.

2025-05-21 13:17:03,700 [DEBUG] PubMed article abstract: Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic inflammatory disease characterized by progressive damage of synovial-lined joints and variable extra-articular manifestations. Tendon and bursal involvement are frequent and often clinically dominant in early disease. RA can affect any joint, but it is usually found in metacarpophalangeal, proximal interphalangeal and metatarsophalangeal joints, as well as in the wrists and knee. Articular and periarticular manifestations include joint swelling and tenderness to palpation, with morning stiffness and severe motion impairment in the involved joints. The clinical presentation of RA varies, but an insidious onset of pain with symmetric swelling of small joints is the most frequent finding. RA onset is acute or subacute in about 25% of patients, but its patterns of presentation also include palindromic onset, monoarticular presentation (both slow and acute forms), extra-articular synovitis (tenosynovitis, bursitis), polymyalgic-like onset, and general symptoms (malaise, fatigue, weight loss, fever). The palindromic onset is characterized by recurrent episodes of oligoarthritis with no residual radiologic damage, while the polymyalgic-like onset may be clinically indistinguishable from polymyalgia rheumatica in elderly subjects. RA is characteristically a symmetric erosive disease. Although any joint, including the cricoarytenoid joint, can be affected, the distal interphalangeal, the sacroiliac, and the lumbar spine joints are rarely involved. The clinical features of synovitis are particularly apparent in the morning. Morning stiffness in and around the joints, lasting at least 1 h before maximal improvement is a typical sign of RA. It is a subjective sign and the patient needs to be carefully informed as to the difference between pain and stiffness. Morning stiffness duration is related to disease activity. Hand involvement is the typical early manifestation of rheumatoid arthritis. Synovitis involving the metacarpophalangeal, proximal interphalangeal and wrist joints causes a characteristic tender swelling on palpation with early severe motion impairment and no radiologic evidence of bone damage. Fatigue, feveret, weight loss, and malaise are frequent clinical signs which can be associated with variable manifestations of extra-articular involvement such as rheumatoid nodules, vasculitis, hematologic abnormalities, Felty's syndrome, and visceral involvement. Although there is no laboratory test to exclude or prove the diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis, several laboratory abnormalities can be detected. Abnormal values of the tests for evaluation of systemic inflammation are the most typical humoral features of RA. These include: erythrocyte sedimentation rate, acute phase proteins and plasma viscosity. Erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein provide the best information about the acute phase response. The C-reactive protein is strictly correlated with clinical assessment and radiographic changes. Plain film radiography is the standard investigation to assess the extent of anatomic changes in rheumatoid arthritis patients. The radiographic features of the hand joints in early disease are characterized by soft tissue swelling and mild juxtaarticular osteoporosis. In the the past 10 years, ultrasonography has gained acceptance for studying joint, tendon and bursal involvement in RA. It may improve the early clinical assessment and the follow-up of these patients, showing such details as synovial thickening even within finger joints. Other imaging techniques, such as magnetic resonance, computed tomography and scintigraphy may provide useful information about both the features and the extent for anatomic damage in selected rheumatoid arthritis patients. The natural history of the disease is poorly defined; its clinical course is fluctuating and the prognosis unpredictable. RA is an epidemiologically relevant cause of disability. An adequate early treatment of RA may alter the diseas

Early diagnosis and appropriate management are essential to prevent joint damage. Patients with RA usually report pain and swelling in multiple joints and prolonged stiffness in the morning that improves with activity. Joint involvement typically is bilateral and symmetric. RA affects large and small joints, particularly the metacarpophalangeal and proximal interphalangeal joints of the hands. Patients with RA may be started on nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, glucocorticoids, or conventional synthetic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) before evaluation by a rheumatologist. Patients who have a poor response to conventional synthetic DMARDs or aggressive arthritis at initial evaluation may be prescribed biologic or targeted synthetic DMARDs. Anti-tumor necrosis factor alpha agents also may be used. Patients typically are managed with a treat-to-target strategy to achieve and maintain low disease activity or remission. Regular monitoring visits using formal assessment of disease activity have been shown to improve outcomes. RA and the medications used in its treatment are associated with increased risks of infections and malignancy. Integrative medicine therapies with limited evidence include acupuncture, mind-body therapies (eg, yoga, tai chi), and dietary supplements.

Tendon and bursal involvement are frequent and often clinically dominant in early disease. RA can affect any joint, but it is usually found in metacarpophalangeal, proximal interphalangeal and metatarsophalangeal joints, as well as in the wrists and knee. Articular and periarticular manifestations include joint swelling and tenderness to palpation, with morning stiffness and severe motion impairment in the involved joints. The clinical presentation of RA varies, but an insidious onset of pain with symmetric swelling of small joints is the most frequent finding. RA onset is acute or subacute in about 25% of patients, but its patterns of presentation also include palindromic onset, monoarticular presentation (both slow and acute forms), extra-articular synovitis (tenosynovitis, bursitis), polymyalgic-like onset, and general symptoms (malaise, fatigue, weight loss, fever). The palindromic onset is characterized by recurrent episodes of oligoarthritis with no residual radiologic damage, while the polymyalgic-like onset may be clinically indistinguishable from polymyalgia rheumatica in elderly subjects. RA is characteristically a symmetric erosive disease. Although any joint, including the cricoarytenoid joint, can be affected, the distal interphalangeal, the sacroiliac, and the lumbar spine joints are rarely involved. The clinical features of synovitis are particularly apparent in the morning. Morning stiffness in and around the joints, lasting at least 1 h before maximal improvement is a typical sign of RA. It is a subjective sign and the patient needs to be carefully informed as to the difference between pain and stiffness. Morning stiffness duration is related to disease activity. Hand involvement is the typical early manifestation of rheumatoid arthritis. Synovitis involving the metacarpophalangeal, proximal interphalangeal and wrist joints causes a characteristic tender swelling on palpation with early severe motion impairment and no radiologic evidence of bone damage. Fatigue, feveret, weight loss, and malaise are frequent clinical signs which can be associated with variable manifestations of extra-articular involvement such as rheumatoid nodules, vasculitis, hematologic abnormalities, Felty's syndrome, and visceral involvement. Although there is no laboratory test to exclude or prove the diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis, several laboratory abnormalities can be detected. Abnormal values of the tests for evaluation of systemic inflammation are the most typical humoral features of RA. These include: erythrocyte sedimentation rate, acute phase proteins and plasma viscosity. Erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein provide the best information about the acute phase response. The C-reactive protein is strictly correlated with clinical assessment and radiographic changes. Plain film radiography is the standard investigation to assess the extent of anatomic changes in rheumatoid arthritis patients. The radiographic features of the hand joints in early disease are characterized by soft tissue swelling and mild juxtaarticular osteoporosis. In the the past 10 years, ultrasonography has gained acceptance for studying joint, tendon and bursal involvement in RA. It may improve the early clinical assessment and the follow-up of these patients, showing such details as synovial thickening even within finger joints. Other imaging techniques, such as magnetic resonance, computed tomography and scintigraphy may provide useful information about both the features and the extent for anatomic damage in selected rheumatoid arthritis patients. The natural history of the disease is poorly defined; its clinical course is fluctuating and the prognosis unpredictable. RA is an epidemiologically relevant cause of disability. An adequate early treatment of RA may alter the diseas", 'pubmed_id': '9652497', 'url': 'https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9652497/', 'confidence': 'Relevant', 'relevance_score': '31.0%', 'relevance_tag': 'Relevant to rheumatoid arthritis, due to symmetrical joint involvement and morning stiffness;', 'source': 'PubMed', 'authors': 'W Grassi, R De Angelis, G Lamanna, C Cervini', 'year': '1998', 'raw_relevance_score': 31.0}, {'title': 'Arthritis: Rheumatoid Arthritis.', 'summary': 'Key principles of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) management include early patient evaluation by a rheumatologist and early initiation of pharmacologic therapy in patients at risk for chronic disease. Early diagnosis and appropriate management are essential to prevent joint damage. Patients with RA usually report pain and swelling in multiple joints and prolonged stiffness in the morning that improves with activity. Joint involvement typically is bilateral and symmetric. RA affects large and small joints, particularly the metacarpophalangeal and proximal interphalangeal joints of the hands. Patients with RA may be started on nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, glucocorticoids, or conventional synthetic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) before evaluation by a rheumatologist. Patients who have a poor response to conventional synthetic DMARDs or aggressive arthritis at initial evaluation may be prescribed biologic or targeted synthetic DMARDs. Anti-tumor necrosis factor alpha agents also may be used. Patients typically are managed with a treat-to-target strategy to achieve and maintain low disease activity or remission. Regular monitoring visits using formal assessment of disease activity have been shown to improve outcomes. RA and the medications used in its treatment are associated with increased risks of infections and malignancy.

2025-05-21 13:25:13,831 [DEBUG] PubMed article abstract: Pericarditis refers to the inflammation of the pericardial layers, resulting from a variety of stimuli triggering a stereotyped immune response, and characterized by chest pain associated often with peculiar electrocardiographic changes and, at times, accompanied by pericardial effusion. Acute pericarditis is generally self-limited and not life-threatening; yet, it may cause significant short-term disability, be complicated by either a large pericardial effusion or tamponade, and carry a significant risk of recurrence. The mainstay of treatment of pericarditis is represented by anti-inflammatory drugs. Anti-inflammatory treatments vary, however, in both effectiveness and side-effect profile. The objective of this review is to summarize the up-to-date management of acute and recurrent pericarditis.

2025-05-21 13:25:18,381 [DEBUG] PubMed article abstract: Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic inflammatory disease characterized by progressive damage of synovial-lined joints and variable extra-articular manifestations. Tendon and bursal involvement are frequent and often clinically dominant in early disease. RA can affect any joint, but it is usually found in metacarpophalangeal, proximal interphalangeal and metatarsophalangeal joints, as well as in the wrists and knee. Articular and periarticular manifestations include joint swelling and tenderness to palpation, with morning stiffness and severe motion impairment in the involved joints. The clinical presentation of RA varies, but an insidious onset of pain with symmetric swelling of small joints is the most frequent finding. RA onset is acute or subacute in about 25% of patients, but its patterns of presentation also include palindromic onset, monoarticular presentation (both slow and acute forms), extra-articular synovitis (tenosynovitis, bursitis), polymyalgic-like onset, and general symptoms (malaise, fatigue, weight loss, fever). The palindromic onset is characterized by recurrent episodes of oligoarthritis with no residual radiologic damage, while the polymyalgic-like onset may be clinically indistinguishable from polymyalgia rheumatica in elderly subjects. RA is characteristically a symmetric erosive disease. Although any joint, including the cricoarytenoid joint, can be affected, the distal interphalangeal, the sacroiliac, and the lumbar spine joints are rarely involved. The clinical features of synovitis are particularly apparent in the morning. Morning stiffness in and around the joints, lasting at least 1 h before maximal improvement is a typical sign of RA. It is a subjective sign and the patient needs to be carefully informed as to the difference between pain and stiffness. Morning stiffness duration is related to disease activity. Hand involvement is the typical early manifestation of rheumatoid arthritis. Synovitis involving the metacarpophalangeal, proximal interphalangeal and wrist joints causes a characteristic tender swelling on palpation with early severe motion impairment and no radiologic evidence of bone damage. Fatigue, feveret, weight loss, and malaise are frequent clinical signs which can be associated with variable manifestations of extra-articular involvement such as rheumatoid nodules, vasculitis, hematologic abnormalities, Felty's syndrome, and visceral involvement. Although there is no laboratory test to exclude or prove the diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis, several laboratory abnormalities can be detected. Abnormal values of the tests for evaluation of systemic inflammation are the most typical humoral features of RA. These include: erythrocyte sedimentation rate, acute phase proteins and plasma viscosity. Erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein provide the best information about the acute phase response. The C-reactive protein is strictly correlated with clinical assessment and radiographic changes. Plain film radiography is the standard investigation to assess the extent of anatomic changes in rheumatoid arthritis patients. The radiographic features of the hand joints in early disease are characterized by soft tissue swelling and mild juxtaarticular osteoporosis. In the the past 10 years, ultrasonography has gained acceptance for studying joint, tendon and bursal involvement in RA. It may improve the early clinical assessment and the follow-up of these patients, showing such details as synovial thickening even within finger joints. Other imaging techniques, such as magnetic resonance, computed tomography and scintigraphy may provide useful information about both the features and the extent for anatomic damage in selected rheumatoid arthritis patients. The natural history of the disease is poorly defined; its clinical course is fluctuating and the prognosis unpredictable. RA is an epidemiologically relevant cause of disability. An adequate early treatment of RA may alter the diseas

2025-05-21 13:25:18,382 [DEBUG] PubMed article abstract: Key principles of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) management include early patient evaluation by a rheumatologist and early initiation of pharmacologic therapy in patients at risk for chronic disease. Early diagnosis and appropriate management are essential to prevent joint damage. Patients with RA usually report pain and swelling in multiple joints and prolonged stiffness in the morning that improves with activity. Joint involvement typically is bilateral and symmetric. RA affects large and small joints, particularly the metacarpophalangeal and proximal interphalangeal joints of the hands. Patients with RA may be started on nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, glucocorticoids, or conventional synthetic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) before evaluation by a rheumatologist. Patients who have a poor response to conventional synthetic DMARDs or aggressive arthritis at initial evaluation may be prescribed biologic or targeted synthetic DMARDs. Anti-tumor necrosis factor alpha agents also may be used. Patients typically are managed with a treat-to-target strategy to achieve and maintain low disease activity or remission. Regular monitoring visits using formal assessment of disease activity have been shown to improve outcomes. RA and the medications used in its treatment are associated with increased risks of infections and malignancy. Integrative medicine therapies with limited evidence include acupuncture, mind-body therapies (eg, yoga, tai chi), and dietary supplements.

Tendon and bursal involvement are frequent and often clinically dominant in early disease. RA can affect any joint, but it is usually found in metacarpophalangeal, proximal interphalangeal and metatarsophalangeal joints, as well as in the wrists and knee. Articular and periarticular manifestations include joint swelling and tenderness to palpation, with morning stiffness and severe motion impairment in the involved joints. The clinical presentation of RA varies, but an insidious onset of pain with symmetric swelling of small joints is the most frequent finding. RA onset is acute or subacute in about 25% of patients, but its patterns of presentation also include palindromic onset, monoarticular presentation (both slow and acute forms), extra-articular synovitis (tenosynovitis, bursitis), polymyalgic-like onset, and general symptoms (malaise, fatigue, weight loss, fever). The palindromic onset is characterized by recurrent episodes of oligoarthritis with no residual radiologic damage, while the polymyalgic-like onset may be clinically indistinguishable from polymyalgia rheumatica in elderly subjects. RA is characteristically a symmetric erosive disease. Although any joint, including the cricoarytenoid joint, can be affected, the distal interphalangeal, the sacroiliac, and the lumbar spine joints are rarely involved. The clinical features of synovitis are particularly apparent in the morning. Morning stiffness in and around the joints, lasting at least 1 h before maximal improvement is a typical sign of RA. It is a subjective sign and the patient needs to be carefully informed as to the difference between pain and stiffness. Morning stiffness duration is related to disease activity. Hand involvement is the typical early manifestation of rheumatoid arthritis. Synovitis involving the metacarpophalangeal, proximal interphalangeal and wrist joints causes a characteristic tender swelling on palpation with early severe motion impairment and no radiologic evidence of bone damage. Fatigue, feveret, weight loss, and malaise are frequent clinical signs which can be associated with variable manifestations of extra-articular involvement such as rheumatoid nodules, vasculitis, hematologic abnormalities, Felty's syndrome, and visceral involvement.

What brings you in to see me? Umm, I had. Blood work done and my globulins were low immunoglobulins. Why did they do that? It was. Of my annual workup and. Low and she wanted to see if it was just a one off situation. So. So she had me do it again the following month. Uh-huh. And they\'re still low, huh? OK, let me look at it. If she sent it in her referral. Umm, Hypogamma. Yeah. Globular anemia. Do you have any history of infection? Sinus infections, bronchitis, pneumonias? No, nothing. You\'ve not sick a lot. Viral infections, Yeast. Nothing. Yeah, yeah, she did send me the labs. But. Maybe I\'ll have my nurses look at it, OK? she had quest labs\n\n    Ensure all medical terms are accurate and contextualized for a professional allergist.

Although more patients with SIgAD are asymptomatic, selected patients suffer from different clinical complications such as pulmonary infections, allergies, autoimmune diseases, gastrointestinal disorders and malignancy. Pathogenesis of SIgAD is still unknown; however, a defective terminal differentiation of B cells and defect in switching to IgA-producing plasma cells are presumed to be responsible. Furthermore, some cytogenic defects and monogenic mutations are associated with SIgAD. There is no specific treatment for patients with symptomatic IgA deficiency, although prophylactic antibiotic therapy along with circumstantial immunoglobulin replacement with justification and supportive care (using a product that contains minimal IgA) could be helpful for patients with a severe phenotype. The epidemiology, pathogenesis, clinical phenotype, diagnosis, prognosis, management and treatment in patients with SIgAD have been reviewed.

2025-05-21 13:40:34,067 [DEBUG] PubMed article abstract: Immunoglobulin A (IgA) deficiency is the most common primary immunodeficiency defined as decreased serum level of IgA in the presence of normal levels of other immunoglobulin isotypes. Most individuals with IgA deficiency are asymptomatic and identified coincidentally. However, some patients may present with recurrent infections of the respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts, allergic disorders, and autoimmune manifestations. IGA AND ITS FUNCTIONS: Although IgA is the most abundant antibody isotype produced in the body, its functions are not clearly understood. Subclass IgA1 in monomeric form is mainly found in the blood circulation, whereas subclass IgA2 in dimeric form is the dominant immunoglobulin in mucosal secretions. Secretory IgA appears to have prime importance in immune exclusion of pathogenic microorganisms and maintenance of intestinal homeostasis. Despite this critical role, there may be some compensatory mechanisms that would prevent disease manifestations in some IgA-deficient individuals.

2025-05-21 13:42:51,643 [DEBUG] PubMed article abstract: Immunoglobulin A (IgA) deficiency is the most common primary immunodeficiency defined as decreased serum level of IgA in the presence of normal levels of other immunoglobulin isotypes. Most individuals with IgA deficiency are asymptomatic and identified coincidentally. However, some patients may present with recurrent infections of the respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts, allergic disorders, and autoimmune manifestations. IGA AND ITS FUNCTIONS: Although IgA is the most abundant antibody isotype produced in the body, its functions are not clearly understood. Subclass IgA1 in monomeric form is mainly found in the blood circulation, whereas subclass IgA2 in dimeric form is the dominant immunoglobulin in mucosal secretions. Secretory IgA appears to have prime importance in immune exclusion of pathogenic microorganisms and maintenance of intestinal homeostasis. Despite this critical role, there may be some compensatory mechanisms that would prevent disease manifestations in some IgA-deficient individuals.

Subclass IgA1 in monomeric form is mainly found in the blood circulation, whereas subclass IgA2 in dimeric form is the dominant immunoglobulin in mucosal secretions. Secretory IgA appears to have prime importance in immune exclusion of pathogenic microorganisms and maintenance of intestinal homeostasis. Despite this critical role, there may be some compensatory mechanisms that would prevent disease manifestations in some IgA-deficient individuals.', 'pubmed_id': '20101521', 'url': 'https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20101521/', 'confidence': 'Recommended', 'relevance_score': '70.0%', 'relevance_tag': 'Relevant to selective iga deficiency', 'source': 'PubMed', 'authors': 'Leman Yel', 'year': '2010', 'raw_relevance_score': 70.0}, {'title': 'ACVIM consensus statement: Guidelines for the identification, evaluation, and management of systemic hypertension in dogs and cats.', 'summary': 'An update to the 2007 American College of Veterinary Internal Medicine (ACVIM) consensus statement on the identification, evaluation, and management of systemic hypertension in dogs and cats was presented at the 2017 ACVIM Forum in National Harbor, MD.

2025-05-21 14:15:32,328 [DEBUG] Semantic Scholar article title: Omalizumab for Severe Allergic Asthma Treatment in Italy: A Cost-Effectiveness Analysis from PROXIMA Study
2025-05-21 14:15:32,329 [DEBUG] Semantic Scholar article abstract: Introduction Inadequately controlled severe asthma patients require additional therapy accounting for significant clinical and economic burden. Our analysis aims to determine the cost-effectiveness of omalizumab in the management of severe allergic asthma in Italy based on observational data from the PROXIMA study. Methods Observational data on efficacy, healthcare resource utilization and changes in quality of life at 12 months after the initiation of omalizumab were examined to estimate the cost-effectiveness compared to pre-omalizumab period and results were expressed with Incremental Cost-Effectiveness Ratio (ICER). The cost–utility analysis estimated the cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained. Direct health costs were assessed from the perspective of the Italian National Health Service (NHS). Results Omalizumab reduced the incidence of exacerbations, number of hospitalizations, physician visits, and improved quality of life after 12 months of treatment. Omalizumab had a greater effectiveness than pre-omalizumab treatment involving 0.132 QALYs gained and led to a €3729 per patient reduction in direct healthcare costs, excluding the add-on treatment cost. Nevertheless, the addition of omalizumab cost led to €7478 increase in total direct costs with respect to pre-omalizumab period. Based on difference in total direct cost and difference in QALY between post and pre-omalizumab period, the ICER was €56,847. According to sensitivity analysis, omalizumab provided a cost-effective use of NHS resources, already at 20% discounted price. Conclusion This study offers a real-world evidence of omalizumab effectiveness in Italy. Despite the high acquisition cost of the innovative drug, omalizumab is a sustainable treatment option for patients with uncontrolled severe allergic asthma.

Our analysis aims to determine the cost-effectiveness of omalizumab in the management of severe allergic asthma in Italy based on observational data from the PROXIMA study. Methods Observational data on efficacy, healthcare resource utilization and changes in quality of life at 12 months after the initiation of omalizumab were examined to estimate the cost-effectiveness compared to pre-omalizumab period and results were expressed with Incremental Cost-Effectiveness Ratio (ICER). The cost–utility analysis estimated the cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained. Direct health costs were assessed from the perspective of the Italian National Health Service (NHS). Results Omalizumab reduced the incidence of exacerbations, number of hospitalizations, physician visits, and improved quality of life after 12 months of treatment. Omalizumab had a greater effectiveness than pre-omalizumab treatment involving 0.132 QALYs gained and led to a €3729 per patient reduction in direct healthcare costs, excluding the add-on treatment cost. Nevertheless, the addition of omalizumab cost led to €7478 increase in total direct costs with respect to pre-omalizumab period. Based on difference in total direct cost and difference in QALY between post and pre-omalizumab period, the ICER was €56,847. According to sensitivity analysis, omalizumab provided a cost-effective use of NHS resources, already at 20% discounted price. Conclusion This study offers a real-world evidence of omalizumab effectiveness in Italy. Despite the high acquisition cost of the innovative drug, omalizumab is a sustainable treatment option for patients with uncontrolled severe allergic asthma.', 'url': 'https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/5e5745c41f62ad1a0850500c052b4beae2ddc4cb', 'authors': 'G.

2025-05-21 14:21:52,725 [DEBUG] Semantic Scholar article title: Omalizumab for Severe Allergic Asthma Treatment in Italy: A Cost-Effectiveness Analysis from PROXIMA Study
2025-05-21 14:21:52,725 [DEBUG] Semantic Scholar article abstract: Introduction Inadequately controlled severe asthma patients require additional therapy accounting for significant clinical and economic burden. Our analysis aims to determine the cost-effectiveness of omalizumab in the management of severe allergic asthma in Italy based on observational data from the PROXIMA study. Methods Observational data on efficacy, healthcare resource utilization and changes in quality of life at 12 months after the initiation of omalizumab were examined to estimate the cost-effectiveness compared to pre-omalizumab period and results were expressed with Incremental Cost-Effectiveness Ratio (ICER). The cost–utility analysis estimated the cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained. Direct health costs were assessed from the perspective of the Italian National Health Service (NHS). Results Omalizumab reduced the incidence of exacerbations, number of hospitalizations, physician visits, and improved quality of life after 12 months of treatment. Omalizumab had a greater effectiveness than pre-omalizumab treatment involving 0.132 QALYs gained and led to a €3729 per patient reduction in direct healthcare costs, excluding the add-on treatment cost. Nevertheless, the addition of omalizumab cost led to €7478 increase in total direct costs with respect to pre-omalizumab period. Based on difference in total direct cost and difference in QALY between post and pre-omalizumab period, the ICER was €56,847. According to sensitivity analysis, omalizumab provided a cost-effective use of NHS resources, already at 20% discounted price. Conclusion This study offers a real-world evidence of omalizumab effectiveness in Italy. Despite the high acquisition cost of the innovative drug, omalizumab is a sustainable treatment option for patients with uncontrolled severe allergic asthma.

Based on difference in total direct cost and difference in QALY between post and pre-omalizumab period, the ICER was €56,847. According to sensitivity analysis, omalizumab provided a cost-effective use of NHS resources, already at 20% discounted price. Conclusion This study offers a real-world evidence of omalizumab effectiveness in Italy. Despite the high acquisition cost of the innovative drug, omalizumab is a sustainable treatment option for patients with uncontrolled severe allergic asthma.', 'url': 'https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/5e5745c41f62ad1a0850500c052b4beae2ddc4cb', 'authors': 'G.

Topical hydrocortisone 1% cream, applied to the affected area twice daily for 7 days if contact dermatitis is confirmed.",
      "Medication interactions and contraindications": "Olopatadine: No significant drug interactions; contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to the drug. Artificial tears: Generally safe, but check for preservatives if sensitive. Hydrocortisone: Avoid prolonged use to prevent skin atrophy; contraindicated in viral infections.",
      "Step-by-step protocol for adjusting medications": "If symptoms persist after 2 weeks of olopatadine, increase frequency to three times daily for another 2 weeks. If no improvement, consider referral to an ophthalmologist. For artificial tears, increase frequency to six times daily if symptoms persist. For hydrocortisone, if no improvement after 7 days, consider stronger topical steroids under dermatologist supervision.",
      "Evidence-based rationale for each medication": "Olopatadine is a mast cell stabilizer and antihistamine effective for allergic conjunctivitis (Source: AAAAI guidelines).

2025-05-21 14:28:46,495 [DEBUG] PubMed article abstract: Ocular allergy (OA), interchangeably known as allergic conjunctivitis, is a common immunological hypersensitivity disorder affecting up to 40% of the population. Ocular allergy has been increasing in frequency, with symptoms of itching, redness, and swelling that significantly impacts an individual's quality of life (QOL). Ocular allergy is an often underdiagnosed and undertreated health problem, because only 10% of patients with OA symptoms seek medical attention, whereas most patients manage with over-the-counter medications and complementary nonpharmacological remedies. The clinical course, duration, severity, and co-morbidities are varied and depend, in part, on the specific ocular tissues that are affected and on immunologic mechanism(s) involved, both local and systemic. It is frequently associated with allergic rhinitis (commonly recognized as allergic rhino conjunctivitis), and with other allergic comorbidities. The predominance of self-management increases the risk of suboptimal therapy that leads to recurrent exacerbations and the potential for development of more chronic conditions that can lead to corneal complications and interference with the visual axis. Multiple, often co-existing causes are seen, and a broad differential diagnosis for OA, increasing the difficulty of arriving at the correct diagnosis(es). Ocular allergy commonly overlaps with other anterior ocular disease disorders, including infectious disorders and dry eye syndromes. Therefore, successful management includes overcoming the challenges of underdiagnosis and even misdiagnosis by a better understanding of the subtleties of an in-depth patient history, ophthalmologic examination techniques, and diagnostic procedures, which are of paramount importance in making an accurate diagnosis of OA. Appropriate cross-referral between specialists (allergists and eyecare specialists) would maximize patient care and outcomes. This would significantly improve OA management and overcome the unmet needs in global health.

Besides the two major forms of contact dermatitis: allergic contact dermatitis and irritant contact dermatitis, other subtypes of CD have been recognized including immediate skin reactions, photoinduced contact dermatitis, systemic contact dermatitis, and non-eczematous contact dermatitis. CD is a great imitator which can mimic many kinds of skin diseases, such as atopic dermatitis, lichen planus, and angioedema. For the diagnosis of CD, a complete medical history, including occupational history, is very important. It can give a clue of CD and provide a list of suspected substances. Besides the well-known diagnostic test, patch testing, there are many other diagnostic tests can be used to help diagnosis of CD and identify the causative allergens, including photopatch test, skin tests for detecting of immediate contact reactions, serum allergen-specific IgE test, and qualitative and quantitative testing of allergen in the suspected materials patients exposed to and challenge test. Before the treatment, the suspected irritants or allergens should be avoided completely. This includes both the removal of the patient from the environment that contains those substances and the promotion of the metabolism and expulsion of the allergens that have been absorbed by the body. In addition, it is also important to restore the skin barrier and reduce skin inflammation through multiple treatments, such as emollients, topical corticosteroids, and antihistamines, as well as systemic corticosteroids and immunosuppressants. Early and appropriate treatments are important to prevent further deterioration and persistence of the skin condition.

2025-05-21 14:28:51,186 [DEBUG] PubMed article abstract: Contact dermatitis is a common inflammatory skin condition characterized by erythematous and pruritic skin lesions that occur after contact with a foreign substance. There are two forms of contact dermatitis: irritant and allergic. Irritant contact dermatitis is caused by the non-immune-modulated irritation of the skin by a substance, leading to skin changes. Allergic contact dermatitis is a delayed hypersensitivity reaction in which a foreign substance comes into contact with the skin; skin changes occur after reexposure to the substance. The most common substances that cause contact dermatitis include poison ivy, nickel, and fragrances. Contact dermatitis usually leads to erythema and scaling with visible borders. Itching and discomfort may also occur. Acute cases may involve a dramatic flare with erythema, vesicles, and bullae; chronic cases may involve lichen with cracks and fissures. When a possible causative substance is known, the first step in confirming the diagnosis is determining whether the problem resolves with avoidance of the substance. Localized acute allergic contact dermatitis lesions are successfully treated with mid- or high-potency topical steroids, such as triamcinolone 0.1% or clobetasol 0.05%. If allergic contact dermatitis involves an extensive area of skin (greater than 20 percent), systemic steroid therapy is often required and offers relief within 12 to 24 hours. In patients with severe rhus dermatitis, oral prednisone should be tapered over two to three weeks because rapid discontinuation of steroids can cause rebound dermatitis. If treatment fails and the diagnosis or specific allergen remains unknown, patch testing should be performed.

This article demonstrated several clinical cases of contact dermatitis in toddlers that were treated with methylprednisolone aceponate accompanied by ceramides and showed high therapy effectiveness in toddlers. A case of treatment of a child aged 1 year, 3 months with asymmetrical widespread hyperemic spots on the back surface of the body, mainly in the lumbar region; a case of treatment of a 2-year-old child with multiple hyperemic spots located on the anterior and, to a greater extent, posterior surface of the lower extremities, having clear edges, accompanied by focal dryness and moderate peeling at the edges; as well as a case of treatment of a child aged 1 year 11 months with hyperemic asymmetrical dry spots of irregular shape on the posterior and medial surface of the left forearm, which tend to merge and have clear edges. The use of topical corticosteroid in combination with ceramides in pediatrics leads to effective and fast inflammation decrease along with visible skin restoration.

A case of treatment of a child aged 1 year, 3 months with asymmetrical widespread hyperemic spots on the back surface of the body, mainly in the lumbar region; a case of treatment of a 2-year-old child with multiple hyperemic spots located on the anterior and, to a greater extent, posterior surface of the lower extremities, having clear edges, accompanied by focal dryness and moderate peeling at the edges; as well as a case of treatment of a child aged 1 year 11 months with hyperemic asymmetrical dry spots of irregular shape on the posterior and medial surface of the left forearm, which tend to merge and have clear edges. The use of topical corticosteroid in combination with ceramides in pediatrics leads to effective and fast inflammation decrease along with visible skin restoration.', 'url': 'https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/f73c2b6c6d4c0247c3dc07732f8a8ab0e6a2465d', 'authors': 'V.

Besides the two major forms of contact dermatitis: allergic contact dermatitis and irritant contact dermatitis, other subtypes of CD have been recognized including immediate skin reactions, photoinduced contact dermatitis, systemic contact dermatitis, and non-eczematous contact dermatitis. CD is a great imitator which can mimic many kinds of skin diseases, such as atopic dermatitis, lichen planus, and angioedema. For the diagnosis of CD, a complete medical history, including occupational history, is very important. It can give a clue of CD and provide a list of suspected substances. Besides the well-known diagnostic test, patch testing, there are many other diagnostic tests can be used to help diagnosis of CD and identify the causative allergens, including photopatch test, skin tests for detecting of immediate contact reactions, serum allergen-specific IgE test, and qualitative and quantitative testing of allergen in the suspected materials patients exposed to and challenge test. Before the treatment, the suspected irritants or allergens should be avoided completely. This includes both the removal of the patient from the environment that contains those substances and the promotion of the metabolism and expulsion of the allergens that have been absorbed by the body. In addition, it is also important to restore the skin barrier and reduce skin inflammation through multiple treatments, such as emollients, topical corticosteroids, and antihistamines, as well as systemic corticosteroids and immunosuppressants.

There are two forms of contact dermatitis: irritant and allergic. Irritant contact dermatitis is caused by the non-immune-modulated irritation of the skin by a substance, leading to skin changes. Allergic contact dermatitis is a delayed hypersensitivity reaction in which a foreign substance comes into contact with the skin; skin changes occur after reexposure to the substance. The most common substances that cause contact dermatitis include poison ivy, nickel, and fragrances. Contact dermatitis usually leads to erythema and scaling with visible borders. Itching and discomfort may also occur. Acute cases may involve a dramatic flare with erythema, vesicles, and bullae; chronic cases may involve lichen with cracks and fissures. When a possible causative substance is known, the first step in confirming the diagnosis is determining whether the problem resolves with avoidance of the substance. Localized acute allergic contact dermatitis lesions are successfully treated with mid- or high-potency topical steroids, such as triamcinolone 0.1% or clobetasol 0.05%. If allergic contact dermatitis involves an extensive area of skin (greater than 20 percent), systemic steroid therapy is often required and offers relief within 12 to 24 hours. In patients with severe rhus dermatitis, oral prednisone should be tapered over two to three weeks because rapid discontinuation of steroids can cause rebound dermatitis.

2025-05-21 15:04:58,271 [DEBUG] PubMed article abstract: Ocular allergy (OA), interchangeably known as allergic conjunctivitis, is a common immunological hypersensitivity disorder affecting up to 40% of the population. Ocular allergy has been increasing in frequency, with symptoms of itching, redness, and swelling that significantly impacts an individual's quality of life (QOL). Ocular allergy is an often underdiagnosed and undertreated health problem, because only 10% of patients with OA symptoms seek medical attention, whereas most patients manage with over-the-counter medications and complementary nonpharmacological remedies. The clinical course, duration, severity, and co-morbidities are varied and depend, in part, on the specific ocular tissues that are affected and on immunologic mechanism(s) involved, both local and systemic. It is frequently associated with allergic rhinitis (commonly recognized as allergic rhino conjunctivitis), and with other allergic comorbidities. The predominance of self-management increases the risk of suboptimal therapy that leads to recurrent exacerbations and the potential for development of more chronic conditions that can lead to corneal complications and interference with the visual axis. Multiple, often co-existing causes are seen, and a broad differential diagnosis for OA, increasing the difficulty of arriving at the correct diagnosis(es). Ocular allergy commonly overlaps with other anterior ocular disease disorders, including infectious disorders and dry eye syndromes. Therefore, successful management includes overcoming the challenges of underdiagnosis and even misdiagnosis by a better understanding of the subtleties of an in-depth patient history, ophthalmologic examination techniques, and diagnostic procedures, which are of paramount importance in making an accurate diagnosis of OA. Appropriate cross-referral between specialists (allergists and eyecare specialists) would maximize patient care and outcomes. This would significantly improve OA management and overcome the unmet needs in global health.

Currently, the world faces myriad challenges related to ocular health, with allergic conjunctivitis emerging as a significant concern, particularly affecting outdoor workers exposed to various environmental factors. Allergic reactions primarily target the eyes and eyelids, necessitating intervention by ophthalmologists who typically employ antihistamines, NSAIDs, corticosteroids, etc., for management.

2025-05-21 15:05:03,625 [DEBUG] PubMed article abstract: Contact dermatitis (CD) is a common inflammatory skin disease caused by exposure to contact allergens and irritants. It is also the most common reason of occupational dermatitis and contributes greatly to hand dermatitis and facial dermatitis. Besides the two major forms of contact dermatitis: allergic contact dermatitis and irritant contact dermatitis, other subtypes of CD have been recognized including immediate skin reactions, photoinduced contact dermatitis, systemic contact dermatitis, and non-eczematous contact dermatitis. CD is a great imitator which can mimic many kinds of skin diseases, such as atopic dermatitis, lichen planus, and angioedema. For the diagnosis of CD, a complete medical history, including occupational history, is very important. It can give a clue of CD and provide a list of suspected substances. Besides the well-known diagnostic test, patch testing, there are many other diagnostic tests can be used to help diagnosis of CD and identify the causative allergens, including photopatch test, skin tests for detecting of immediate contact reactions, serum allergen-specific IgE test, and qualitative and quantitative testing of allergen in the suspected materials patients exposed to and challenge test. Before the treatment, the suspected irritants or allergens should be avoided completely. This includes both the removal of the patient from the environment that contains those substances and the promotion of the metabolism and expulsion of the allergens that have been absorbed by the body. In addition, it is also important to restore the skin barrier and reduce skin inflammation through multiple treatments, such as emollients, topical corticosteroids, and antihistamines, as well as systemic corticosteroids and immunosuppressants. Early and appropriate treatments are important to prevent further deterioration and persistence of the skin condition.

2025-05-21 15:05:03,627 [DEBUG] PubMed article abstract: Contact dermatitis is a common inflammatory skin condition characterized by erythematous and pruritic skin lesions that occur after contact with a foreign substance. There are two forms of contact dermatitis: irritant and allergic. Irritant contact dermatitis is caused by the non-immune-modulated irritation of the skin by a substance, leading to skin changes. Allergic contact dermatitis is a delayed hypersensitivity reaction in which a foreign substance comes into contact with the skin; skin changes occur after reexposure to the substance. The most common substances that cause contact dermatitis include poison ivy, nickel, and fragrances. Contact dermatitis usually leads to erythema and scaling with visible borders. Itching and discomfort may also occur. Acute cases may involve a dramatic flare with erythema, vesicles, and bullae; chronic cases may involve lichen with cracks and fissures. When a possible causative substance is known, the first step in confirming the diagnosis is determining whether the problem resolves with avoidance of the substance. Localized acute allergic contact dermatitis lesions are successfully treated with mid- or high-potency topical steroids, such as triamcinolone 0.1% or clobetasol 0.05%. If allergic contact dermatitis involves an extensive area of skin (greater than 20 percent), systemic steroid therapy is often required and offers relief within 12 to 24 hours. In patients with severe rhus dermatitis, oral prednisone should be tapered over two to three weeks because rapid discontinuation of steroids can cause rebound dermatitis. If treatment fails and the diagnosis or specific allergen remains unknown, patch testing should be performed.

Ocular allergy has been increasing in frequency, with symptoms of itching, redness, and swelling that significantly impacts an individual's quality of life (QOL). Ocular allergy is an often underdiagnosed and undertreated health problem, because only 10% of patients with OA symptoms seek medical attention, whereas most patients manage with over-the-counter medications and complementary nonpharmacological remedies. The clinical course, duration, severity, and co-morbidities are varied and depend, in part, on the specific ocular tissues that are affected and on immunologic mechanism(s) involved, both local and systemic. It is frequently associated with allergic rhinitis (commonly recognized as allergic rhino conjunctivitis), and with other allergic comorbidities. The predominance of self-management increases the risk of suboptimal therapy that leads to recurrent exacerbations and the potential for development of more chronic conditions that can lead to corneal complications and interference with the visual axis. Multiple, often co-existing causes are seen, and a broad differential diagnosis for OA, increasing the difficulty of arriving at the correct diagnosis(es). Ocular allergy commonly overlaps with other anterior ocular disease disorders, including infectious disorders and dry eye syndromes.

It is also the most common reason of occupational dermatitis and contributes greatly to hand dermatitis and facial dermatitis. Besides the two major forms of contact dermatitis: allergic contact dermatitis and irritant contact dermatitis, other subtypes of CD have been recognized including immediate skin reactions, photoinduced contact dermatitis, systemic contact dermatitis, and non-eczematous contact dermatitis. CD is a great imitator which can mimic many kinds of skin diseases, such as atopic dermatitis, lichen planus, and angioedema. For the diagnosis of CD, a complete medical history, including occupational history, is very important. It can give a clue of CD and provide a list of suspected substances. Besides the well-known diagnostic test, patch testing, there are many other diagnostic tests can be used to help diagnosis of CD and identify the causative allergens, including photopatch test, skin tests for detecting of immediate contact reactions, serum allergen-specific IgE test, and qualitative and quantitative testing of allergen in the suspected materials patients exposed to and challenge test. Before the treatment, the suspected irritants or allergens should be avoided completely. This includes both the removal of the patient from the environment that contains those substances and the promotion of the metabolism and expulsion of the allergens that have been absorbed by the body. In addition, it is also important to restore the skin barrier and reduce skin inflammation through multiple treatments, such as emollients, topical corticosteroids, and antihistamines, as well as systemic corticosteroids and immunosuppressants.

There are two forms of contact dermatitis: irritant and allergic. Irritant contact dermatitis is caused by the non-immune-modulated irritation of the skin by a substance, leading to skin changes. Allergic contact dermatitis is a delayed hypersensitivity reaction in which a foreign substance comes into contact with the skin; skin changes occur after reexposure to the substance. The most common substances that cause contact dermatitis include poison ivy, nickel, and fragrances. Contact dermatitis usually leads to erythema and scaling with visible borders. Itching and discomfort may also occur. Acute cases may involve a dramatic flare with erythema, vesicles, and bullae; chronic cases may involve lichen with cracks and fissures. When a possible causative substance is known, the first step in confirming the diagnosis is determining whether the problem resolves with avoidance of the substance. Localized acute allergic contact dermatitis lesions are successfully treated with mid- or high-potency topical steroids, such as triamcinolone 0.1% or clobetasol 0.05%. If allergic contact dermatitis involves an extensive area of skin (greater than 20 percent), systemic steroid therapy is often required and offers relief within 12 to 24 hours. In patients with severe rhus dermatitis, oral prednisone should be tapered over two to three weeks because rapid discontinuation of steroids can cause rebound dermatitis.

      "summary": "Ocular allergy (OA), interchangeably known as allergic conjunctivitis, is a common immunological hypersensitivity disorder affecting up to 40% of the population. Ocular allergy has been increasing in frequency, with symptoms of itching, redness, and swelling that significantly impacts an individual's quality of life (QOL). Ocular allergy is an often underdiagnosed and undertreated health problem, because only 10% of patients with OA symptoms seek medical attention, whereas most patients manage with over-the-counter medications and complementary nonpharmacological remedies. The clinical course, duration, severity, and co-morbidities are varied and depend, in part, on the specific ocular tissues that are affected and on immunologic mechanism(s) involved, both local and systemic. It is frequently associated with allergic rhinitis (commonly recognized as allergic rhino conjunctivitis), and with other allergic comorbidities. The predominance of self-management increases the risk of suboptimal therapy that leads to recurrent exacerbations and the potential for development of more chronic conditions that can lead to corneal complications and interference with the visual axis. Multiple, often co-existing causes are seen, and a broad differential diagnosis for OA, increasing the difficulty of arriving at the correct diagnosis(es). Ocular allergy commonly overlaps with other anterior ocular disease disorders, including infectious disorders and dry eye syndromes. Therefore, successful management includes overcoming the challenges of underdiagnosis and even misdiagnosis by a better understanding of the subtleties of an in-depth patient history, ophthalmologic examination techniques, and diagnostic procedures, which are of paramount importance in making an accurate diagnosis of OA. Appropriate cross-referral between specialists (allergists and eyecare specialists) would maximize patient care and outcomes.

Hi, Doctor Samuel, nice to meet you. Who sent you over to me? OK, that\'s Gregory, right, Shedlock? OK, so tell me what\'s going on with you. He sent me over here to see if maybe you might be able to figure out what is causing. My problem with my sinuses and my lungs. Where he\'s done everything on his end, he believes. I\'ve also seen a lung doctor doctor which keeps saying you have allergies and, and, and, you know, looking at how to keep explaining to him that what has happened. I\'ve never had allergies in my life and I know that. OK, you can end up down the road maybe having them, but what has happened in my lifetime? When I was younger, I used to work for a company and we tore out an oven that had asbestos and when I said I tore it, we tore it out. The walls dropped. The dust went out the window. You couldn\'t see the building anymore because of how thick the dust was weaves in it. All we had was a little paper mask. We were covered from head to toe. It was the fire department that come up and told us that this product that was all over us would kill you. We had no idea what this stuff was harmless and that\'s the reason why. Our company was told to tear it out, you know, so when we took it, you know, took it out and they didn\'t want to pay the money for people that knew how to, you know, what to do right way. So they just used us regular workers that work there that had no idea because we were cheaper. You know, I\'ll just have these guys. It should be hard, you know, to take it apart, you know, But they didn\'t tell us anything. Mm-hmm. So basically all eight of us got exposed to this stuff real heavy, I mean. It it, it, it was all in our skin. My body looked like I was covered in snow. And it got up and I used to wake up in the middle of the night for days, months. Even a year or two later used to wake up gasping for air. How long ago was the exposure? That was back in 79. It lasted like that for that\'s how I wanted up meeting Doctor Greenfield. Umm and everything was because. So what did the pulmonologist say The. The pulmonologist said you have asthma. Yeah. He thought that what I had was reminisce from the asbestos exposure or no. He figured it was because I had my cats. Hmm. And I\'ve had my cats and dogs for for my lifetime. So are you on Advair for asthma inhaler? I haven\'t a little inhaler. Purple. Yeah. And blue both. Yeah. So you do that every day? The purple one. I was doing the one every day until I got a real bad infection. Real bad. And then I got COVID, so I stopped doing because there was a guy down at work that that I mean, this guy come in and work and gave it to half a dozen of us. So they gave me, you know, stuff for that. So I stopped using anything for that because I didn\'t know if it would mess anything up. Does it work? It just kind of helps. It hasn\'t made anything go away, hasn\'t stopped anything. And like I told my doctor when I I went to work for Chris Craft, they have a real fine powder of fiberglass. And it\'s called umm, and when you crack, you know, cut it open with the router or saw whatever, it goes in the air and even though we were wearing little paper mask and everything. It got up into my sinuses and a bunch of times I went and when I saw Doctor Wash at the time when Doctor Wash was my doctor, bunch of times I would end up getting an infection from it getting down into my chest and then with my sinuses. So he gave me pills to order to help. Trying to stop it, but because of that, that\'s how everything is just messed up completely now, \'cause it\'s just, I guess, like you get exposed to this and now you\'re exposed to this and you put it together and now it\'s made it what was. Barely worse. Made it worse. So you\'re still seeing the pulmonologist for your asthma? When was the, uh, I saw him back in January. OK, so just keep following the breathing test with them. Can I request records from them for the lungs? Yeah. Who\'s your doctor? The pulmonary Dr. I\'m terrible at names, I\'m sorry. That\'s fine. So we need records of them. He is funny, but Doctor Bhatt. Utpal Bhatt. Yeah, He\'s from India. He is, but he\'s MCR. Yeah, he\'s a doctor. MCR from MCR. Yeah. I think it\'s Doctor Hutt. OK. Yeah, he is funny. As can we. Mm-hmm. All right. So. We\'ll get records from him. So you\'ve never been allergy tested? Environmental trees, weeds, grasses, catdogs, dust mites. No, I mean, so let\'s, I\'m not even, I put it to you this way. I\'m not even allergic to Poison Ivy, OK? I\'ve. I\'ve been stung by bees, Wasps and everything. But I think they want me to test you, right? For allergies. Let\'s do that. OK. OK. Not taken any allergy medicine, right? No, no. Do you get any nasal congestion, runny nose, sneezing, sniffling? That\'s always \'cause I work in a freezer. Tropicana now. OK, so let me test you. You don\'t take any medicine for allergies like Zyrtec, Claritin, Benadryl now? No, because the Claritin doesn\'t work. Any nose spread nose spray? He gave me a nose spray, but I haven\'t used that in a while. OK, let me test you and see what. That wasn\'t to me that I didn\'t know if it just felt like it wasn\'t working OK, and I told him that too. Like I said, it doesn\'t seem like anything is working. It\'s stopping it because I So what did so did the. Yeah, flat. And this stuff will get into my stomach and into my chest, and I wind up throwing up. So you had Flonase and Loratadine. So nothing worked out. It becomes heavy. OK, so. But. But who suggested seeing me? Your primary care or Doctor Bhatt? Your pulmonologist? My primary. Not Doctor Bhatt didn\'t want you to. OK. All right. It\'s not that he didn\'t want me to see him, it\'s just he didn\'t, no, he didn\'t suggest it \'cause he was trying everything. And then he said come back and see him. I\'m also go back and see him. OK. And he\'s diagnosed you with COPD or no? No, your dad mom had to COPD. And you just had a colonoscopy. Otherwise you\'re healthy. No other medical issues except the asthma. Well, I don\'t know you want to call it asthma or I I just know that that my chest, I wind up when I tie my shoe out of air. I can go outside and do this. No, this here they gave me. This when I went to the primary place right there by Publix in Paris, Yeah, well, I had an infection real heavy and I was coughing real bad and sneezing. I couldn\'t get my breath air. So when I went to him, he said. Your infection\'s real bad. Sure, this is what you need to do. So you definition that. Oh, that\'s a long time ago. Deep breath, deep breath. Your chest today. Umm, yeah. Night at 7:00 this morning. OK, but I\'m sure that purple inhaler, Dr. Bhatt told you to take it every day. That\'s supposed to be taken every day. I would restart it. OK. Every day. The purple 2 puffs twice a day on the one puff. I don\'t know. Is it a discus or an inhaler? No, it\'s an inhaler. SO2 puffs in the morning. At night, every day, OK, that\'ll make you feel better. Your lungs and the blue one as needed. OK, the albuterol, that\'s just a rescue inhaler going on every day. And then like I said, I stopped doing it when they told me that I got COVID. No, do it so it don\'t stop regardless even. Because because that\'ll help you prevent going into an asthma attack. OK, like getting those oral steroid redness on it\'s bad. Keep don\'t stop your inhaler. OK OK, so doctor, doctor, but OK when he wants to stop only then otherwise every day. OK, OK, I\'ll do a full allergy test on you for pollens cat dog. Might mold everything. OK, OK, I know she. Well, the mold part was there \'cause I I was living in a house at the roof actually fell apart and I was in there for a couple of months before I got out of hopeless pneumonia, sinus infection. You don\'t get sick a lot, maybe once a year or more than that. No constant I can pick up an infection. Sinus, yeah, it\'ll be. Sinus it\'ll be how long, how long, how many times a year do you get antibiotics? You\'d have to ask the doctor. He can check approximately maybe 3-4 times. So maybe I\'ll do a blood work to see if your immune system\'s working. OK. Why do you do you get pneumonias a lot too, or no, Just yeah. Here. Yeah. Oh, no, it\'s it\'s it\'s always here. Always to hear up here. OK. Umm. I\'ll do a blood work. OK for immune deficiency? Yeah. OK. Any eczema, rashes, hives? Nothing on your body skin. No, I got I got psoriasis, psoriasis, psoriasis and that\'s controlled yeah, I got to shop for it It\'s it\'s cleared it up OK, I\'ve been taking it for umm 6 months prior to now and you add these up umm it\'s almost a year OK and they switched the medication from. One from Omera to this other stuff. OK, that starts with an A and like I said, it\'s good. It works good. No food allergies, right? No food cheese. What happened? I won\'t what happens? I\'ll swell up. I\'ll be in the hospital in a second. I\'ll be. Biggest orange cheese, but milk is fine. Milk is fine. Huh. Drink milk all day long. No drug allergy. Bee sting allergy was no correct. Nothing. No. When I was three years old I got stung by maybe I don\'t know how many different bees I went and my uncle had a farm and I went into the beehive. Oh, and I came out of that beehive and I was just literally screaming \'cause I was stung so bad. I had so many bees on it, but no like shortness of breath or passing out. Uh, I winded up in the hospital. Hmm uh, but never been again after. It\'s bad reaction right after that. No, I haven\'t, I can get stung. OK. Like nothing happened. So you they, I know they talk to you about the can you do the allergy testing? Dollars, you know this, these three, but 25% of it. So how much would it be? Let me say that\'s the question is, is I\'m trying to figure out how much total would it be, Yeah. Your insurance doesn\'t cover so it\'s 60. Let me see if I can do the math. 180 * 25% would be $50 less, so about 170 or something total. Yeah, no, for the whole allergy test and office visit and everything. I think it\'ll be around. Maybe that\'s Max. Yeah. Yeah, I can swing that. Yeah. I\'ll use my card, \'cause I didn\'t bring that on me. I brought, I brought $100 \'cause I thought that, you know, OK, I\'ll work with you. Whatever. Yeah, we\'ll see. OK. Yeah. So let\'s get your allergy test started, OK. All right, I\'ll be back. Like I said, if it wasn\'t for being exposed to all that stuff, I\'d probably be perfect. Yeah, I know. Right. Thank you so much. Perfect. Uh, OK. What? Oh yeah. Let me tell Helen to start.

  "differential_diagnosis": "Primary Diagnosis: Occupational Asthma due to asbestos and fiberglass exposure. Alternative Diagnoses: 1) Allergic Rhinitis, possibly triggered by environmental allergens; 2) Chronic Sinusitis with recurrent infections.",
  "diagnostic_workup": "1. Comprehensive allergy testing to assess for environmental allergens including pollens, cat, dog, dust mites, and mold. 2. Pulmonary function tests to evaluate asthma severity and response to current therapy. 3. Blood work to assess immune function due to frequent infections. 4. Request records from Dr. Utpal Bhatt for detailed lung function history and previous treatments.",
  "plan_of_care": "In regards to Occupational Asthma:\n- Restart Advair (fluticasone/salmeterol) 2 puffs twice daily as prescribed by Dr. Bhatt.\n- Use albuterol inhaler as needed for acute symptoms.\n- Implement environmental controls to minimize exposure to potential irritants at work.\nIn regards to Allergic Rhinitis:\n- Await results of allergy testing to tailor treatment.\n- Consider initiating intranasal corticosteroids if testing confirms allergies.\nIn regards to Chronic Sinusitis:\n- Continue antibiotic therapy as prescribed for infections.\n- Consider referral to an ENT specialist for further evaluation and management.\nIn regards to Follow-Up:\n- Schedule follow-up appointment in 4 weeks to review allergy test results and adjust treatment plan.\n- Monitor symptoms and adherence to medication regimen.\nIn regards to Emergency Management:\n- Educate on proper use of albuterol inhaler for acute asthma exacerbations.\n- Provide EpiPen training due to severe cheese allergy, with instructions to use in case of accidental exposure.",
  "patient_education": "Educate the patient on the importance of daily use of Advair to control asthma symptoms. Discuss strategies to avoid exposure to known irritants at work, such as wearing appropriate protective equipment. Provide guidance on managing sinus infections and recognizing signs of asthma exacerbation. Emphasize the need for adherence to the treatment plan and the importance of follow-up appointments.",

  "summary": "The patient presents with chronic respiratory issues likely related to occupational exposure to asbestos and fiberglass. He has been diagnosed with asthma and is currently using Advair and albuterol. Allergy testing is planned to assess for environmental triggers, and blood work will evaluate immune function due to frequent infections. A follow-up in 4 weeks will review results and adjust the treatment plan.",
  "enhanced_recommendations": "1. Medication Management:\n   - Advair (fluticasone/salmeterol) 2 puffs twice daily via inhaler. Albuterol inhaler 2 puffs as needed for acute symptoms.\n   - No known interactions with current medications; however, monitor for potential interactions with any new medications.\n   - Adjust Advair dosage based on symptom control: increase to 4 puffs twice daily if symptoms persist, decrease if symptoms are well-controlled for 3 months.\n   - Advair is recommended for long-term asthma control based on GINA guidelines; albuterol is used as a rescue inhaler per NHLBI guidelines.\n\n2. Lifestyle Modifications:\n   - Implement HEPA air filters at home and work to reduce exposure to allergens and irritants.\n   - Wear a N95 mask at work to minimize exposure to freezer air and potential allergens.\n   - Avoid known allergens such as cheese; consider dietary consultation for safe alternatives.\n   - Engage in moderate exercise, such as walking, to improve lung function, but avoid high-intensity activities that may trigger asthma.\n   - Practice stress reduction techniques like mindfulness meditation to help manage asthma triggers.\n\n3. Monitoring Protocol:\n   - Monitor peak flow readings daily using a peak flow meter; record readings in a symptom diary.\n   - Track asthma symptoms and medication use in a digital app or paper diary, noting frequency and severity.\n   - Contact healthcare provider if peak flow readings drop below 80% of personal best or if symptoms worsen despite medication.\n   - Use a smart inhaler device to track adherence and effectiveness of medication.\n   - Document exposure to potential triggers and correlate with symptom exacerbations.\n\n4. Emergency Action Plan:\n   - Use albuterol inhaler immediately if experiencing shortness of breath or wheezing; repeat after 20 minutes if symptoms persist.\n   - Seek emergency care if symptoms do not improve after 2 uses of albuterol, or if severe symptoms such as chest pain or blue lips occur.\n   - Use EpiPen (epinephrine auto-injector) in case of severe allergic reaction to cheese; inject into outer thigh and seek emergency care.\n   - Instruct family members on recognizing signs of asthma exacerbation and EpiPen use.\n\n5. Long-term Management Strategy:\n   - Reassess treatment plan every 3 months based on symptom control and peak flow readings.\n   - Goal: achieve asthma control with minimal symptoms and no exacerbations requiring emergency care.\n   - Consider step-up therapy with additional controller medications if symptoms persist despite current regimen.\n   - Criteria for success: no emergency visits, minimal use of rescue inhaler, and stable peak flow readings.\n   - Refer to a pulmonologist for specialized management if asthma remains uncontrolled after 6 months.\n\n6. Patient Education Resources:\n   - 'Living Well with Asthma' by the American Lung Association.\n   - Asthma and Allergy Foundation of America (AAFA) website for support groups and resources.\n   - WebMD Asthma Health Center for reliable online information.\n   - 'AsthmaMD' mobile app for tracking symptoms and medication use.\n\n7. Follow-up Schedule:\n   - Follow-up appointment in 4 weeks to review allergy test results and adjust treatment plan.\n   - Complete pulmonary function tests and blood work before next visit.\n   - Bring records from Dr. Bhatt, peak flow readings, and symptom diary to the appointment.\n   - Expectation: improved symptom control and reduced need for rescue inhaler use by next visit.",

2025-06-20 10:22:29,189 [DEBUG] PubMed article abstract: There is a frequently encountered subset of hypothyroid patients who are refractory to standard thyroid hormone replacement treatment and require unexpectedly high doses of levothyroxine. In addition to clinical situations where hypothyroid patients are non-compliant, or where there is the possibility of excipient-induced disease exacerbation (gluten/celiac disease), therapeutic failure may be due to impaired absorption of the administered drug. The common approach to managing patients with unusual thyroxine needs is to escalate the dose of levothyroxine until targeted TSH levels are achieved. This approach can increase the risk for prolonged exposure to supratherapeutic doses of levothyroxine, which increase the chances of adverse outcomes. Repeated adjustments of levothyroxine can also escalate the costs of treatment, as frequent office visits and laboratory tests are required to determine and maintain the desired dose. Clinicians should take a systematic approach to managing patients whom they suspect of having treatment-refractory hypothyroidism. This may include searching for, and adjusting, occult medical conditions and/or other factors that may affect the absorption of levothyroxine, before up-titrating the dose of traditional levothyroxine therapy. Depending on the underlying pathology, another approach that may be considered is to try alternative formulations of levothyroxine that are less susceptible to intolerance issues related to excipients, or, in some cases, to malabsorption. The early discovery of these factors via a thoughtful patient work-up may avoid unnecessary thyroid medication adjustments and their consequences for both patients and clinicians.

In addition to clinical situations where hypothyroid patients are non-compliant, or where there is the possibility of excipient-induced disease exacerbation (gluten/celiac disease), therapeutic failure may be due to impaired absorption of the administered drug. The common approach to managing patients with unusual thyroxine needs is to escalate the dose of levothyroxine until targeted TSH levels are achieved. This approach can increase the risk for prolonged exposure to supratherapeutic doses of levothyroxine, which increase the chances of adverse outcomes. Repeated adjustments of levothyroxine can also escalate the costs of treatment, as frequent office visits and laboratory tests are required to determine and maintain the desired dose. Clinicians should take a systematic approach to managing patients whom they suspect of having treatment-refractory hypothyroidism. This may include searching for, and adjusting, occult medical conditions and/or other factors that may affect the absorption of levothyroxine, before up-titrating the dose of traditional levothyroxine therapy. Depending on the underlying pathology, another approach that may be considered is to try alternative formulations of levothyroxine that are less susceptible to intolerance issues related to excipients, or, in some cases, to malabsorption. The early discovery of these factors via a thoughtful patient work-up may avoid unnecessary thyroid medication adjustments and their consequences for both patients and clinicians.', 'pubmed_id': '28695483', 'url': 'https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28695483/', 'confidence': 'Recommended', 'relevance_score': '55.0%', 'relevance_tag': 'Relevant to hypothyroidism exacerbation', 'source': 'PubMed', 'authors': 'M Centanni, S Benvenga, I Sachmechi', 'year': '2017', 'raw_relevance_score': 55.00000000000001}, {'title': 'Team Up!', 'summary': 'N/A', 'pubmed_id': '28385316', 'url': 'https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28385316/', 'confidence': 'Highly Recommended', 'relevance_score': '100.0%', 'relevance_tag': 'Relevant to hypothyroidism exacerbation', 'source': 'PubMed', 'authors': 'Mary Norine Walsh', 'year': '2017', 'raw_relevance_score': 100}]

Less appreciated is that depression's tremendous burdens are not shared equally among all who become depressed. Some will suffer recurrences over the rest of their lives, whereas half or more will never have a recurrence. Based on these two distinctive life course prototypes, we propose a subtype distinction for research on the origins and lifetime course of major depression. A pressing goal is to determine at the time of depression's first onset who will follow which clinical trajectory. The lack of recognition of this distinction has resulted in many obstacles, including conceptual biases, methodological oversights, and definitional dead ends. Current theories are reviewed and compared. The implications for contemporary diagnostic controversies, reevaluating research on treatment and prevention, and enhancing the predictive strength of traditionally weak indicators of recurrences and recurrent depression are discussed.

2025-06-20 10:22:39,796 [DEBUG] PubMed article abstract: Vitamin D and calcium have different biological functions, so the need for supplementation, and its safety and efficacy, need to be evaluated for each separately. Vitamin D deficiency is usually the result of low sunlight exposure (e.g., in frail older people, those who are veiled, those with dark-skin living at higher latitudes) and is reversible with calciferol 400-800 IU/day. Calcium supplements produce a 1% increase in bone density in the first year of use, without further increases subsequently. Vitamin D supplements do not improve bone density in clinical trials except in analyses of subgroups with baseline levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D <30 nmol/L. Supplementation with calcium, vitamin D, or their combination does not prevent fractures in community-dwelling adults, but a large study in vitamin D-deficient nursing home residents did demonstrate fracture prevention. When treating osteoporosis, co-administration of calcium with anti-resorptive drugs has not been shown to impact on treatment efficacy. Correction of severe vitamin D deficiency (<25 nmol/L) is necessary before use of potent anti-resorptive drugs to avoid hypocalcemia. Calcium supplements cause gastrointestinal side effects, particularly constipation, and increase the risk of kidney stones and, probably, heart attacks by about 20%. Low-dose vitamin D is safe, but doses >4000 IU/day have been associated with more falls and fractures. Current evidence does not support use of either calcium or vitamin D supplements in healthy community-dwelling adults.

When treating osteoporosis, co-administration of calcium with anti-resorptive drugs has not been shown to impact on treatment efficacy. Correction of severe vitamin D deficiency (<25 nmol/L) is necessary before use of potent anti-resorptive drugs to avoid hypocalcemia. Calcium supplements cause gastrointestinal side effects, particularly constipation, and increase the risk of kidney stones and, probably, heart attacks by about 20%. Low-dose vitamin D is safe, but doses >4000 IU/day have been associated with more falls and fractures.

In addition to clinical situations where hypothyroid patients are non-compliant, or where there is the possibility of excipient-induced disease exacerbation (gluten/celiac disease), therapeutic failure may be due to impaired absorption of the administered drug. The common approach to managing patients with unusual thyroxine needs is to escalate the dose of levothyroxine until targeted TSH levels are achieved. This approach can increase the risk for prolonged exposure to supratherapeutic doses of levothyroxine, which increase the chances of adverse outcomes. Repeated adjustments of levothyroxine can also escalate the costs of treatment, as frequent office visits and laboratory tests are required to determine and maintain the desired dose. Clinicians should take a systematic approach to managing patients whom they suspect of having treatment-refractory hypothyroidism. This may include searching for, and adjusting, occult medical conditions and/or other factors that may affect the absorption of levothyroxine, before up-titrating the dose of traditional levothyroxine therapy. Depending on the underlying pathology, another approach that may be considered is to try alternative formulations of levothyroxine that are less susceptible to intolerance issues related to excipients, or, in some cases, to malabsorption. The early discovery of these factors via a thoughtful patient work-up may avoid unnecessary thyroid medication adjustments and their consequences for both patients and clinicians.', 'pubmed_id': '28695483', 'url': 'https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28695483/', 'confidence': 'Recommended', 'relevance_score': '55.0%', 'relevance_tag': 'Relevant to hypothyroidism exacerbation', 'source': 'PubMed', 'authors': 'M Centanni, S Benvenga, I Sachmechi', 'year': '2017', 'raw_relevance_score': 55.00000000000001}, {'title': 'Team Up!', 'summary': 'N/A', 'pubmed_id': '28385316', 'url': 'https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28385316/', 'confidence': 'Highly Recommended', 'relevance_score': '100.0%', 'relevance_tag': 'Relevant to hypothyroidism exacerbation', 'source': 'PubMed', 'authors': 'Mary Norine Walsh', 'year': '2017', 'raw_relevance_score': 100}, {'title': "Canadian Network for Mood and Anxiety Treatments (CANMAT) 2023 Update on Clinical Guidelines for Management of Major Depressive Disorder in Adults: Réseau canadien pour les traitements de l'humeur et de l'anxiété (CANMAT) 2023 : Mise à jour des lignes directrices cliniques pour la prise en charge du trouble dépressif majeur chez les adultes.", 'summary': 'The Canadian Network for Mood and Anxiety Treatments (CANMAT) last published clinical guidelines for the management of major depressive disorder (MDD) in 2016.

The model predicts that improvement in its 6 interrelated components-self-management support, clinical information systems, delivery system redesign, decision support, health care organization, and community resources-can produce system reform in which informed, activated patients interact with prepared, proactive practice teams. Case studies are provided describing how components of the chronic care model have been implemented in the primary care practices of 4 health care organizations.",

      "summary": "Melasma is a common, acquired, chronic cutaneous pigment disorder that is often difficult to treat and has a high recurrence rate. The goal of a melasma treatment regimen is to decrease pigment production and increase elimination. Topical tyrosinase inhibitors block melanin synthesis and thereby reduce pigment production. Peels and laserand light-based devices increase melanin elimination. A multimodality treatment approach targeting both pigment production and elimination is necessary to achieve equilibrium and disease remission. Maintenance treatments are often necessary due to the high recurrence rate. Strict photoprotection is critical to prevent melanogenesis and rebound. Targeting the vasculature via pulsed dye laser or tranexamic acid is another approach to treatment.",
