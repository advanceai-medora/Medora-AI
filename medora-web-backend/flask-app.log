In regards to Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease:
Patient was diagnosed with acid reflux one month ago by her primary care physician. She has been taking omeprazole every morning for a couple of weeks. The cough persisted despite the use of omeprazole. The patient has been trying to avoid caffeine and eats 2-3 hours before bedtime. She sleeps with elevated pillows and maintains a diet rich in fruits and vegetables, though she occasionally indulges in snacks and candies.

Plan:
- Continue omeprazole every morning as prescribed

In regards to Chronic Cough:
Patient has experienced a persistent cough for the last 7-8 years, occurring once or twice a year, lasting from 2 weeks to a month and a half. The cough is seasonal, worsening in spring and fall. Previous treatments included Zyrtec daily, steroids (Oro), Flonase as needed, and an allergy pill, which provided temporary relief. The patient has not taken allergy medicine for the past 2 weeks. The cough has been absent for about a month.

Plan:
- Perform full allergy testing today, including pollen, cat, dog, dust mites, and mold
- Conduct full breathing test today, including a pre- and post-breathing treatment assessment to evaluate for asthma

In regards to Suspected Allergic Rhinitis:
Patient experiences nasal congestion during coughing fits, which may be related to allergies. She has been taking Zyrtec daily during allergy seasons but has not taken it for the past 2 weeks.

Plan:
- Await results of allergy testing to confirm or rule out allergic rhinitis

In regards to Suspected Asthma:
Patient has a chronic cough with no other symptoms such as wheezing, shortness of breath, or difficulty breathing. The cough has been treated with steroids and Flonase in the past, which provided temporary relief.

Plan:
- Await results of breathing test to confirm or rule out asthma
