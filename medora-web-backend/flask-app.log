* Ariana experienced a severe anaphylactic reaction after consuming cashews for the first time, which resulted in swollen eyes, rash, and difficulty breathing, necessitating two doses of epinephrine and treatment at Sarasota Memorial Hospital.
* It is crucial to confirm the allergen responsible for the reaction through skin prick testing for tree nuts, excluding peanuts and hazelnuts, as Ariana has consumed peanuts multiple times without issue and hazelnuts post-reaction without symptoms.
* Treatment plan includes immediate administration of epinephrine via EpiPen in case of future reactions, with Ariana's mother instructed to keep the EpiPen accessible at all times, especially in public settings like restaurants.
* Patient education will focus on recognizing early signs of anaphylaxis, such as swelling, rash, and breathing difficulties, and the importance of avoiding all tree nuts until testing results are available.
* Follow-up appointment scheduled in two weeks to review allergy test results and adjust the management plan accordingly, ensuring Ariana's safety and well-being.

In regards to Nut Allergy:
* Ariana's severe reaction to cashews suggests a possible tree nut allergy, though she has tolerated peanuts and hazelnuts without issue.
* Comprehensive skin prick testing will be conducted to identify specific tree nut allergens, excluding peanuts and hazelnuts, to guide dietary restrictions and emergency preparedness.
* Treatment plan includes strict avoidance of all tree nuts until testing results are available, with Ariana's mother advised to read food labels carefully and inform caregivers and school staff about the potential allergy.
* Patient education will emphasize the importance of avoiding cross-contamination and the need to carry an EpiPen at all times, with instructions on how to use it in case of an emergency.
* Follow-up appointment in two weeks to discuss test results and establish a long-term management plan, including dietary adjustments and emergency protocols.

In regards to Eczema:
* Ariana has a history of eczema, though she has not experienced a flare-up recently, indicating that her condition is currently well-managed.
* Current treatment includes topical emollients and moisturizers as needed, with no recent use of clindamycin or prednisone for eczema management.
* Plan to continue current eczema management with regular use of moisturizers to prevent flare-ups, and to monitor for any changes in skin condition.
* Patient education will focus on maintaining skin hydration, avoiding known irritants, and recognizing early signs of eczema flare-ups to seek timely treatment.
* Follow-up in three months or sooner if symptoms worsen, to reassess eczema management and adjust treatment as necessary.

In regards to Seasonal Allergies:
* Ariana experiences persistent symptoms of seasonal allergies, including nasal congestion, runny nose, and itchy eyes, for which she takes Zyrtec as needed.
* Current treatment includes Zyrtec (cetirizine) as needed, though she has not used it in the past five days in preparation for allergy testing.
* Plan to perform comprehensive environmental allergy testing today to identify specific allergens and develop a targeted treatment approach, potentially including daily antihistamines or nasal corticosteroids.
* Patient education will emphasize the importance of regular use of allergy medications during peak seasons and the potential benefits of allergen avoidance strategies.
* Follow-up appointment in two weeks to review environmental allergy test results and adjust the treatment plan, ensuring optimal management of Ariana's seasonal allergies.

2025-06-14 20:05:24,040 [INFO] Extracted conditions: ['anaphylaxis', 'nut allergy', 'eczema', 'seasonal allergies']
2025-06-14 20:05:32,224 [INFO] Generated Freed-style plan: In regards to Anaphylaxis:
* Ariana experienced a severe anaphylactic reaction after consuming cashews for the first time, which resulted in swollen eyes, rash, and difficulty breathing, necessitating two doses of epinephrine and a visit to the emergency department.
* It is crucial to confirm the allergen responsible for the reaction through skin prick testing for cashews, walnuts, and pecans, while avoiding peanut testing due to her history of frequent peanut consumption without issues.
* Ariana should always carry an EpiPen and her caregivers must be trained in its use; they should administer it immediately upon signs of an allergic reaction and seek emergency medical care.
* Educate Ariana's family on the importance of strict avoidance of all tree nuts, reading food labels carefully, and informing restaurants and schools about her nut allergy to prevent accidental exposure.
* Schedule a follow-up appointment in 4 weeks to review the results of the allergy testing and adjust the management plan accordingly.

In regards to Nut Allergy:
* Ariana has a confirmed allergy to cashews, as evidenced by her severe reaction after first exposure, and potential cross-reactivity with other tree nuts should be investigated.
* Perform skin prick testing for cashews, walnuts, and pecans to identify specific tree nut allergies and guide dietary restrictions.
* Ariana must avoid all tree nuts and products containing tree nuts, and her caregivers should be vigilant about reading labels and preventing cross-contamination.
* Provide Ariana's family with resources on managing food allergies, including emergency action plans and support groups.
* Schedule a follow-up in 6 months or sooner if there are any concerns or accidental exposures to reassess her allergy status and dietary management.

In regards to Eczema:
* Ariana has a history of eczema, though she has not had a recent flare-up, indicating that her skin condition is currently well-managed.
* Continue current management strategies for eczema, including the use of moisturizers and avoiding known triggers such as harsh soaps and detergents.
* If eczema flares occur, consider the use of topical corticosteroids such as hydrocortisone 1% cream applied twice daily for up to 2 weeks, and refer to a dermatologist if needed.
* Educate Ariana's caregivers on the importance of maintaining skin hydration and recognizing early signs of eczema flares to prevent severe outbreaks.
* Follow up in 6 months or sooner if eczema flares occur to reassess her skin condition and adjust treatment as necessary.

In regards to Seasonal Allergies:
* Ariana experiences year-round nasal congestion and other symptoms suggestive of seasonal allergies, for which she takes Zyrtec as needed.
* Perform comprehensive environmental allergy testing to identify specific allergens contributing to her symptoms and guide targeted treatment.
* Consider initiating daily antihistamine therapy with cetirizine (Zyrtec) 10 mg once daily during peak allergy seasons, and discuss the potential addition of a nasal corticosteroid spray such as fluticasone propionate (Flonase) one spray in each nostril daily if symptoms persist.
* Educate Ariana's family on the importance of avoiding known allergens, maintaining indoor air quality, and using air purifiers to reduce exposure to environmental triggers.
* Schedule a follow-up appointment in 3 months to review her response to treatment and adjust the management plan as needed.

* Ariana experienced a severe anaphylactic reaction after consuming cashews for the first time, which resulted in swollen eyes, rash, and difficulty breathing, necessitating two doses of epinephrine and a visit to the emergency department.
* It is crucial to confirm the specific allergen causing the reaction through skin prick testing for all tree nuts except hazelnuts, as she has tolerated hazelnuts without issue.
* Ariana must carry an EpiPen at all times and ensure it is readily accessible, especially in public settings such as restaurants where cross-contamination with nuts could occur.
* Educate Ariana and her caregivers on the signs of anaphylaxis and the immediate use of the EpiPen, followed by calling emergency services.
* Follow-up appointment scheduled in 2 weeks to review allergy test results and adjust the management plan accordingly, including potential referral to an allergist for further evaluation if needed.

In regards to Nut Allergy:
* Ariana has a confirmed allergy to cefprozil and a suspected allergy to cashews, with a history of consuming peanuts without issue until the recent reaction.
* Comprehensive skin prick testing will be conducted to identify specific nut allergies, excluding peanuts and hazelnuts, to guide dietary restrictions and emergency preparedness.
* Ariana should strictly avoid all tree nuts except hazelnuts, and caregivers must be vigilant about reading food labels and inquiring about ingredients when dining out.
* Prescribe Zyrtec 10 mg daily as needed for mild allergic reactions, and ensure Ariana's caregivers understand the importance of consistent use during high-risk periods.
* Schedule a follow-up in 6 months or sooner if new symptoms arise, to reassess dietary restrictions and consider further testing or desensitization if appropriate.

In regards to Eczema:
* Ariana has a history of eczema, though she has not experienced a flare-up recently, indicating good control with current management strategies.
* Continue to monitor for signs of eczema exacerbation, such as dry, itchy, or inflamed skin, and treat promptly with over-the-counter emollients and topical corticosteroids as needed.
* Educate Ariana and her caregivers on skin care routines, including daily moisturizing and avoiding known irritants, to prevent eczema flares.
* If eczema symptoms worsen or do not respond to current treatments, consider a referral to a dermatologist for further evaluation and potential prescription of stronger topical or systemic medications.
* Follow-up in 3 months to review eczema management and adjust the treatment plan if necessary, ensuring Ariana's skin remains well-controlled and comfortable.

2025-06-14 21:07:16,298 [INFO] Generated Freed-style plan: In regards to Allergies:
* Laura has been undergoing allergy immunotherapy, commonly known as allergy shots, since November, aimed at desensitizing her to specific allergens that trigger her symptoms.
* She experienced a setback due to a misunderstanding about the frequency of her shots, resulting in a missed month and a reduction in her dose level from nearly reaching the yellow vial back to the blue vial at a concentration of 0.05.
* Laura should continue her weekly allergy shots to progress through the vials, with the goal of reaching her final dose within the next 6 months; she is encouraged to come three times a week to quickly move past the blue vial and into the yellow vial, after which she can reduce to twice weekly if she is not experiencing reactions.
* In addition to the shots, Laura has been using an oral antihistamine, such as Allegra or Zyrtec, on the day of her shot to manage any immediate symptoms; she should continue this practice and consider adding Flonase or Azelastine nasal sprays if her symptoms worsen or persist.
* It is important for Laura to understand that stopping the shots prematurely could lead to a recurrence of her symptoms, as the full course of immunotherapy typically requires 3 to 5 years to achieve lasting desensitization.
* Follow-up appointments should be scheduled every 6 months to monitor her progress and adjust the treatment plan as necessary; Laura should communicate any difficulties with scheduling to ensure she can maintain the required frequency of her shots.

In regards to Allergic Rhinitis:
* Laura's symptoms of allergic rhinitis are being managed with the allergy shots and the use of an oral antihistamine on the day of her shots, indicating that her nasal symptoms are under control with the current regimen.
* She should continue to monitor her symptoms and report any changes or worsening of her nasal congestion, sneezing, or itchy and watery eyes to her allergist.
* If Laura experiences a flare-up of her allergic rhinitis symptoms, she should consider adding a nasal corticosteroid like Flonase or an antihistamine nasal spray like Azelastine to her daily routine, using one spray in each nostril once or twice daily as needed.
* Education on allergen avoidance strategies, such as keeping windows closed during high pollen seasons and using air purifiers, should be provided to help minimize her exposure to triggers.
* Follow-up visits should include a review of her nasal symptoms and adjustments to her medication regimen if necessary, with the goal of maintaining symptom control while progressing through her immunotherapy.
