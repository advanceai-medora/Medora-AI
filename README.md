# Medora - AI-Powered Scribe

## Overview

Medora is an AI-powered scribe application developed by **AdvanceAI.AI**, based in Bradenton, Florida, designed to assist healthcare providers, especially allergists, in managing patient consultations efficiently. By leveraging advanced speech recognition and natural language processing, Medora streamlines documentation and delivers actionable health insights, reducing administrative workload and enhancing patient care.

  - Specific allergen detection (e.g., "Pollen," "Peanuts") with visual symbols (e.g., üå≥ for Environmental, üçΩÔ∏è for Food).
  - Detailed asthma status (e.g., "Daily Severe," "Pollen Trigger").
  - Immunology profile (e.g., "Low (Sinus Infections)," "Elevated (Redness)").
